TODO: Rewrite this?

When I arrived in Bucharest it was my first time in eastern Europe, and you know what it felt like?

Eastern Europe.

Sometimes you go places and they surprise you. When I first went to China it was nothing like I expected. Bucharest though, I got off the plane and was like _"Oh look, eastern Europe."_

I'm not sure what it is that makes it feel like eastern Europe, whether it's the accents and mannerisms of the people, the cars that look distinctively eastern European, the architecture, a combination of these or something else altogether, but if you've never been to Bucharest and you're reading this article to get an idea what it's like, then it's just like you're imagining.

Bucharest centers around the Old Town, which unfortunately has fallen the way of other European cities in catering to British stag parties. I didn't spend much time in the Old Town after dark, but even during the daytime, the neo-Brancovean architecture is mired by the signs for adult entertainment. When you branch-out from the overtly touristy town centre, Bucharest quickly becomes a gratifyingly habitable and at times pleasant place to be.

In their own way, Bucureștean people are friendly and welcoming. Perhaps not as obviously as elsewhere, but I can appreciate displays of true emotion as opposed to false smiles. When you return somewhere that people have got to know you, they become warmer with each visit.

It's a city that feels very clean and open. The roads are wide and largely void of heavy traffic, so it's a pleasant place to walk around, even though the public transport network goes to all corners of the city. Plus, if you really want to get away there are a couple of large parks within easy reach of the city centre. To go for a run or a relaxing walk, Tineretului Park is what you expect a city centre park to be. For a bit more wilderness, head to Văcărești Nature Park, which is largely untouched and brimming with wildlife.

One thing that took me a bit of getting used to, is how subtle and non-descript many businesses are. It's a feature of western capitalism that a business shout louder than its competitors to attract custom. Every business on a high-street in London has colourful signage to declare their presence and to draw your attention from elsewhere. In Bucharest it's not like that. There are bars that from the outside do little to indicate that there are dozens of people buying drinks on the rooftop. The gym which I signed-up to has no signage whatsoever. It was only thanks to Google Maps that I knew there was a gym there at all, and when I happened to see someone in workout clothes, I followed them.

Romania uses the Latin alphabet, which unlike several nearby countries, makes it very easy for an English speaker. Not speaking a word of Romanian myself, I could understand roughly one in every ten words I read, just because they were similar to English words, or to the few French/Spanish/Italian words that I know. It also means that Google Translate is pretty much 100% accurate when pointing your phone at something, so even buying food where the packaging is only written in Romanian, it's still easy to understand the ingredients.

In terms of its affordability, I won't hide that I came to Bucharest simply because Romania is one of the cheapest countries in the EU, and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit more expensive than south-east Asian countries, so don't come here expecting to get by on what you paid in Bangkok, but compared to somewhere like London, Bucharest is gloriously cheap, and it doesn't come at the cost of infrastructure.

I paid €6 for a 4G SIM with 100GB of data that lasted me the entire month I was here. Tethering my laptop to my mobile hotspot, this was comfortably fast enough for video calls. The wifi that I had in my room was the fastest I've ever used, consistently having upload and download speeds exceeding 500mbps.

Bucharest is truly a great place for a digital nomad, particularly one with an EU passport. There were though, two things that I didn't like here.

The first was that there's very evident drug addiction in the city. You regularly walk past people spazzed-out on whatever it is they've taken. And while that didn't cause me any issues directly, I like the comfort of being surrounded by rational and predictable behaviour.

The second was that everyone smokes in Bucharest, and I do mean everyone. Men smoke, women smoke, children smoke.

I'm not joking, I saw a school trip and half the kids had cigarettes. And you know the one thing in the world I hate?

Smoking.

It is at least confined to outdoor areas, or to areas that can be perceived as outdoors, so you don't have to worry about someone lignting-up if you're sitting indoors at a restaurant, but if you go to an outdoor bar? If you go for a run in the park? If you walk down the street? Smoking everywhere.

## How affordable is Bucharest?

Very. It's the best value capital city within the EU. You'll pay less than 230 lei per night for really nice Airbnbs here. If you're on a budget you can find much cheaper accommodation. A beer in a bar will cost you around 18 lei and a single trip on the metro is 5 lei.

## Paying for things in Bucharest

The currency of Romania is the Romanian leu, which has the plural forf lei, which is what you'll commonly see prices suffixed with. In international currency terms you'll see the abbreviation RON.

Card payments including Apple Pay are accepted basically everywhere. That includes being able to pay for metro tickets using your phone.

During my first visit in 2023, and small number of businesses were still cash only - I specifically remember having to pay for my gym membership in cash. During my 2025 visit I didn't have to use cash once. Everything that I paid for was with Apple Pay.

## What language is spoken in Bucharest?

Romanian.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Bucharest?

One advantage that Romania has over many of its neighbours is that it uses the Roman alphabet. Even if you don't know a word of Romanian, which I don't, it comes across to me as a mish-mash of other European languages, so if you speak English and have only a rudimentary knowledge of other major European languages, you might find that you can understand more written Romanian than you'd expect.

If you go to the supermarket and see 'produse vegane', I probably don't need to tell you that means indicates the vegan section. Or if you see 'Acces Parcare' and 'Nu blocati accesul în parcare', it won't take you too long to understand that means 'car park access' and 'don't blocks access to the car park'. 'Ceai verde' means green tea, 'case de bilete' means ticket office, and I'll give you one guess how to say 'carp' in Romanian.

This doesn't mean that you'll be able to understand everything that you read - you won't, not even close, but you won't feel as lost as you do in other parts of the world either.

In terms of how widely English is spoken, you shouldn't expect it from everyone, but most people that you're likely to deal with, for example those working in restaurants or in barber shops, typically speak some English. I found it pretty easy to get by here.

## How is the Internet in Bucharest?

Lightning fast and reliable.

In my first room here in 2023, the download speeds were over 600mbps and upload speeds over 500mbps. In my second room in 2025 I had 400mbps download and 425mbps upload speeds. I had no reliability issues, and haven't been anywhere in the city without strong mobile coverage.

## Getting in and out of Bucharest

If you're arriving or departing Bucharest by air, you'll likely be doing so at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/VX59Ksh2zRwTHDcN9'>Henri Coandă International Airport</ExternalLink>, Bucharest's main airport, located 16.5km north of the city centre. The most hassle-free way of getting there from the city centre is on the airport train, which runs 24 hours per day, departing in each direction between the airport and <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6LxR7ufhRRZ7poRX7'>Gara de Nord</ExternalLink> every 40 minutes. The journey time takes 20 minutes and tickets cost [6 lei].

[TODO: Add how to buy tickets and catch the train]

Gara de Nord is on lines 1 and 4 of the metro, so taking the underground from here to wherever you're staying is easy.

If arriving or departing by bus, there are two main bus terminals. <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/sa1vwkV6kBtCnXMH8'>Autogara Militari</ExternalLink> is west of the city centre, but an easy walk from Păcii metro station on line 3. When I took a bus to Sofia in 2023, this is where it departed from. I've never had to go there myself, but I understand that <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/V5sQmoAwpWeunxkr9'>Autogara Filaret</ExternalLink> also has long distance buses.

## Is Bucharest safe?

I've seen nothing to make me think that it's not, and that includes wandering the streets coming out of bars in the middle of the night.

The one thing to be aware of is that Bucharest has a very evident problem with drug addiction. You will be asked for money a lot, and you'll see a lot of people clearly off their tits. I've never felt threatened by them though.

## Who is Bucharest suitable for?

Being in the EU and being as affordable as it is, Bucharest is most suited to EU passport holders on a budget. As of 2025 Romania is a fully-fledged member of the Schengen Area, meaning that it's no longer suitable for nomads looking for a Schengen cool-off.

It's got a lot of green space, so it's very suited to those who like to get outside a lot, and it's a very vegan-friendly city.

The social scene here is a little underwhelming. While it does exist, it't not as vibrant as in other places, so it's perhaps not suited for nomads who're very socially-needy.

So basically if you're a poor, vegan, introvert who likes the outdoors and has an EU passport, you're going to love it here. It's why I came back again.

## Is the tap water drinkable in Bucharest?

Very much so.

## Things I don't like about Bucharest

### Smoking

Bucharest hasn't escaped the plague that infects the rest of Eastern Europe, with an uncomfortably high proportion of the population doing what they can to give everyone else cancer.

Smoking is at least banned indoors, but good luck trying to breathe clean air while walking down the street.

### Drug addiction

Particularly in the city centre, although certainly not limited to it, you'll see a lot of evidence of drug addiction. People trying to fly, that kind of thing.

That means that firstly, you're going to have a lot of people ask you for money. And secondly, there are a lot of people behaving erratically. I've never seen any violence directed towards other people, but I did see one guy get into a fight with a trash can. That kind of unpredictability can put you on edge.

### Emergency messages

The Bucharest authorities are way, way too trigger happy with those emergency messages that get sent to your phone, where even if it's on silent and on do not disturb, it'll start wailing at you. On multiple occasions I've been in the middle of video calls with my phone on do not disturb, when they've been sent, which is pretty embarrassing.

If these messages were being sent for legitimate reasons I wouldn't mind, but the first one I received during my second stay in Bucharest, was because someone had misplaced their child.

Ok, great. Thanks for telling me.

There was another one when everyone was told to seek emergency shelter from an incoming storm. It didn't even rain. Multiple others came telling me about a heatwave. It wasn't even that hot, it only got to 38°C. That's good running weather.

My guess is that the authorities are so paranoid that they'll face criticism if anything happens and they didn't send out an emergency message, that they just send them out for anything. But fuck in Hell they get annoying.

  },
]

<ImageGallery images={dislikesImages} />

## Being sociable in Bucharest

The social scene for digital nomads in Bucharest isn't completely dead, but it's certainly a bit sickly.

Facebook is a clutter of adverts disguised as events, and there aren't many bars that are appealing to go for a beer by yourself. I find my social life here limited to a small number of active Meetup groups in Bucharest, such as <ExternalLink url='https://www.meetup.com/bucharest-digital-nomads/'>Bucharest Digital Nomads</ExternalLink>, which holds events at differing bars around Bucharest.

If having an active social life is important to you, then Bucharest might not be for you.

## Running in Bucharest

Like many cities in Europe, Bucharest is very running-friendly. While the pavements are quiet enough and the pollution insignificant enough that you can comfortably run along the pavements here, there's really no need as there are some really great parks in Bucharest.

### Tineretului Park

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/AgPQKS9SuYQrxYSJ6'>Tineretului Park</ExternalLink> is a big park south of the city centre. During my second visit to Bucharest, when I was staying intentionally close by, I came here pretty much everyday to either walk, run, or just get outside and get some sun.

The most obvious running route here is to do laps of the lake, one circumference of which is 2.8km. It's got a wide path all the way around, shared by runners, cyclists, walkers, rollerbladers and electric scooters. Apart from one small corner that's home to a lot of birds that stay off the path unless some genius parents decide to take their kids to feed them, there are no real bottlenecks, so you can comfotably run in either direction.

At the north-eastern tip of the lake you'll find a drinking fountain, with a few others dotted around the park. Even if you don't want to run, this is a great place for a lunchtime walk. There are hundreds of benches all over the park if you want to relax, or quite well hidden on top of a hill is a <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/mhBRpvGwHoEn455F9'>calisthenics area</ExternalLink> where you can come to do some pull-ups.

The one obvious and expected deficiency in this park is the number of people that smoke here, where they make every effort to annoy as many people exercising as possible. Given the size of the park, this isn't as bad as at some other parks in Eastern Europe.

### Văcărești Natural Park

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vBE64sfmxc3QRcgQ8'>Văcărești Natural Park</ExternalLink> is probably my favourite place in Bucharest. It's a slightly peculiar place, because it's surrounded by this big, concrete bowl, and as typically happens when you build something out of concrete, people graffiti all over it. That makes it slightly unwelcoming, made even more so by how inconspicuous the entrances are.

It perhaps explains why there's barely ever anyone else here, but I love it. The presumed intention of the bowl is that it keeps all pollution, including noise pollution, out of the park, which it does very effectively. The park is boredered on two sides by a main road, but once you're inside you wouldn't know it. It's a very peaceful, untamed area of parkland within easy reach of Bucharest city centre. For walking or running, I suggest it's on your list of places to come in Bucharest.

If you're running here you've got two options. You can either go down into the park where there are some trails that are suitable. Or you can run around the edge of the bowl. I prefer the latter.

The top of the bowl has a path that goes all the way around it, with one lap being 5.14km. The downside of this is that it's being on top of the bowl you're not protected from the noise of the nearby roads, and you're also out in the open with little shade, so you get some noise from the surrounding roads, but it's otherwise a nice run.

As Văcărești is fairly close to Tineretului Park, you can easily combine them into a longer run, the only downside being that to get between the parks you have to cross a couple of main roads that'll interrupt your rhythm.

### Izvor Park

Izvor Park is much smaller than the two parks mentioned above, with one loop being just 1.25km, but as it was so close to my first room in Bucharest, I really put my laps in here. If you're staying near the city centre and can't be arsed to go to Tineretului Park, it's probably your best bet.

Unsurprisingly it's full of nobheads smoking, which is good cardio training as you have to hold your breath while running past them. And if you come at the wrong time of day, there are packs of poorly attended children. I think a local school or nursery takes them there sometimes, which is annoying because you have to kick them all out of the way. Other than that it's a nice place to do laps, and being right in front of the Palace of Parliament is a bonus.

## Getting vegan food in Bucharest

Being vegan in Bucharest is as easy as anywhere else that I've been.

While there are only a small two fully-vegan restaurants in the city centre, and not many more further-out, most restaurants here have something vegan on the menu, so you're not going to struggle.

Even better is that the supermarkets are very vegan friendly - you'll find a lot of intentionally vegan items while you're shopping. This is definitely a city to get accommodation with a kitchen if you can.

### Level Up

<MapLink name='Strada Sfânta Vineri 10' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/cBRwMsvA9qnLtvYw5' />

Level Up is one of the two fully-vegan restaurants in the city centre. It serves vegan takes of a mix of foreign and local foods, with burgers and pizzas dominating the menu. It's definitely not a place to come to be healthy.

From the outside it looks tiny, but that's because most of the seating is downstairs in a really comfortable room that includes six sofas. The staff are really friendly, they speak English, and there's an English copy of the menu. It's all good with one notable caveat: They only open at 2pm. They've got to be the only restaurant in the world that opens right after the lunch-rush.

  },
]

<ImageGallery images={levelUpImages} />

### Sublimmme

<MapLink name='Splaiul Independenței' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/cvE1tSVHAbAbSXtB7' />

Sublimme is the other fully-vegan restaurant that you'll find in the city centre. It's much more health-focussed than Level Up.

On weekdays they have a menu of the day, which for 49 lei includes of a soup and a main dish. I recommend that simply because service can otherwise be a bit slow. And while they do open each day at 11am, wait until midday before coming here. If you come at 11:15am like I did one day, they'll complain that they haven't had time to get ready yet, like that's your fault.

The restaurant itself is pretty comfortable. It has three sofas, although one is always occupied by a staff member's laptop. Once the food arrives, it's always very good.

### Groceries

Vegan grocery shopping in Bucharest is as easy as anywhere else that I've been.

The main city centre supermarket is <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/e6bqcvrrVywAj3YK6'>Carrefour</ExternalLink>. It has two floors, and up on the second floor it has a large 'free from' section that includes many vegan items like protien bars, that aren't available in the supermarkets of other major cities in this region. It also has dedicated vegan sections in the chilled and frozen sections.

Even more vegan-friendly than Carrefour is Mega Image - they have small to medium-sized branches all over the city, and just in those you're going to find a lot of intentionally vegan items. Sausages, nuggets, even cheesecake and other things to make yourself fat.

If for some reason you can't find what you need in these stores, Mega Image has some larger branches like the one on <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/DdN1Qi3P3RWMLvSF7'>General Gheorghe Magheru street</ExternalLink>, which is spread over two floors. It's as good of a place to do vegan grocery shopping as anywhere I've come across in this part of the world.

Between Carrefour and Mega Image you're well covered for groceries, but I was going through a bit of a fitness-kick during my second stay in Bucharest, meaning I wanted vegan multivitamins and vegan protein powders. For those and other vegan supplements, I found that <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ABxhC8Fxw4pKX1P49'>Bebe Tei</ExternalLink> was the best place.

It's a slightly odd store, in that from the outside it looks like a mother and baby store. Their logo is a pram and the items most prominently on display are children's toys, buggies, cots and high chairs. I felt a bit odd walking in here for the first time as a lone, childless man. However, once you get past the mothering section, they have a health food section that includes some vegan foods that you might not be able to find elsewhere, but also an overwhelming amount of supplements, including many that are vegan-friendly.

## Where I stayed

Either through luck or skill, I've had two absolutely amazing Airbnbs in Bucharest. I don't have a bad word to stay about either of them. Finding them on Airbnb wasn't a struggle like in other places - there seems to just be a lot of really high quality accommodation in Bucharest.

This was the first place that I stayed in Bucharest, and it was perfect.

It's very near to the city centre while still being in a local area. Izvor Park is a short walk away, giving you some nearby green space. The large Carrefour supermarket in the centre of town is about a fifteen minute walk from the room. Izvor and Piața Unirii metro stations are both about an eight minute walk away, and two of Bucharest's four vegan restaurants are also easy walking distance.

The room is on the third floor of an apartment block. From the outside the apartment block doesn't look great, but once you're inside it's lovely. It's a one-bedroom apartment, but the living area has ample space for yoga and other exercise. There's a TV and an air conditioner in both the bedroom and the living room, and the sofa is sufficiently comfortable that I often worked on it when on my laptop, even thought there's a dining table and four chairs that you can use to setup an actual workspace. The wifi here in 2023 was the fastest I'd ever used, consistently have over 600mbps and 500mbps download and upload speeds respectively. The kitchen includes a large fridge/freezer, an oven and a cooker, and more cooking tools/utensils than you'd expect to find in an Airbnb. In the bedroom you have a comfortable double bed with plenty of storage space, and there's a balcony that's really pleasant to sit on with a book and a cup of tea, provided the people on adjacent balconies aren't smoking (which they normally are).

That alone would make it a five-star Airbnb, but what I really loved about this place is how much every little detail had been thought about by the host. So many snacks and drinks are included with the room. That includes nineteen different types of craft beer, one bottle of whiskey, two bottles of wine, many soft drinks, peanuts, crisps, chocolate, popcorn and even fresh fruit. If you then go into the bathroom cupboard you'll find every chemical you could need, from things you might expect like laundry detergent and shampoo, to things you're never going to need, like nail polish remover. In the bedroom cupboard you'll find more clean towels and sheets than you'll know what to do with, and search around the apartment and you'll find extension cords and converter plugs.

I carry everything that I need with me, just because many hosts aren't so thoughtful, but even I still appreciated how much thought had gone into making my stay as comfortable here as it could be.

My only criticism, and it's one that echoes around my entire sentiment of Bucharest, is that people in other apartments smoke on the balconies. If you happen to have the windows open and the person next door starts smoking, the smoke blows-in. So where I might have preferred to keep the windows open and the AC turned-off, I generally kept the windows closed.

Unless you find a detached house in the middle of Bucharest, that's going to be a problem anywhere. This is still up there as the best Airbnb I've stayed at. I would love to come back again again.

I was so dejected at my previous accommodation being unavailable when I decided to come back to Bucharest that I almost changed my plans to go to another city altogether, but eventually decided that I'd come back and stay here instead, and that was a good move. This is a great apartment.

It perhaps didn't have quite as many of the nice little touches as the room above, but I was still very impressed by how much was included. Many different teas, oil, salt and pepper to cook with, more toilet roll that I would use in a year, and even a bottle of wine in the fridge.

It's a gold-themed room, which I really liked. The walls are gold, the lights are gold, the taps are gold, the cuttlery is gold, even the bum gun is gold. Yes, I did say that.

To the uninitiated, a bum gun is a water hose that sits behind the toilet and is used like a handheld bidet. They're behind every toilet in South-East Asia, and my biggest frustration when I come back to Europe each year is that they don't exist here and I have to use toilet paper instead like some kind of peasant. Except it exists in this apartment, and not only is the bum gun here gold, but it has a temperature control, meaning you can spray hot or cold water up your arse. Even Thailand isn't that advanced yet.

The location of this apartment is close to perfect. Tineretului Park is just a short walk away, and there's not one, but two medium-sized branches of Mega Image a 5-10 minute walk away, including on the way back from the park, so getting groceries while staying here is easy, as is cooking them seeing as the kitchen contains just about every utensil that you're going to need. Tineretului metro station is just outside the apartment, and you're about a 25-minute walk from the centre of town.

The living room here is really comfortable. It has a very long and comfortable sofa, which is great for working from, and it faces a large TV. There's plenty of floor space to workout on, and there's a desk that includes an external monitor. Both the living room and the bedroom have air conditioning units.

If I could level one criticism, and this is me really being pedantic, it's that it doesn't have any outdoor space. A balcony to sit and have a cup of green tea in the morning would be the icing on the cake, but with a park so nearby, it's really not necessary. I loved this room, and given its location, might even rate it ahead of the one above.

## Do I want to come back to Bucharest again?

I absolutely love my life as a digital nomad and I'll live out the rest of my days like this if I can. Unfortunately, at some point reality is probably going to bring me back down to earth.

Whether it's for financial reasons, for medical reasons, because I can't find remote work anymore, or some other reason altogether, a time is one day going to come when I have to settle down and live like a normal person again. And when that time does come, Bucharest is going to be at or near the top of my list. For what I look for in a city, it has it all.

It's affordable, it's very vegan-friendly, it's got loads of open, green space, it's got low pollution levels, the people are mostly friendly, and it's in the EU, meaning I can stay here forever without any red tape.

I hope that day is a long way off, but in the meantime I will for sure be back in Bucharest to visit. I love it here.
