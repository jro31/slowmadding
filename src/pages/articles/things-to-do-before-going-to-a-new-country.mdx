While the hope is always for a smooth arrival when you go somewhere new, the world can be an unpredictable place. If your mobile network isn't working, or even worse you lose your phone altogether, are you prepared enough that you can get from the airport to your room? What about if you get an immigration officer who doesn't want to let you in? How can you give yourself the best chance? And do you know enough about the local currency to not get ripped-off?

This article will make sure you're prepared for as many eventualities as possible, in the event that things don't go as smoothly as you hoped.

You might not believe this considering the lifestyle I've chosen, but I hate travelling. On a day when you travel from one location to another, your day goes something like:

- Check-out of your current room
- Go to the airport
- Check-in for your flight
- Go through immigration of the country you're leaving
- Take your flight
- Go through immigration of your new country
- Hope that the airline hasn't lost your bag
- Get to your new room
- Check-in to your new roomand you can be tripped-up at any one of those stages, depending on your luck for the day.

It's a miserable experience, but the pay-off for experiencing such a day every few weeks or months, is that you get to spend your life in a constant state of flux, which makes it worth it. Just.

While things that should be simple, like checking-out of your current room, can trip you up (like when a hotel needs to return your deposit but there's no one at the desk all morning), there's not really much you can do to prepare for that, other than communicate well with your hosts and know the checkout procedure. And I'm going to assume that you're now familiar enough with the city that you're leaving that getting to the airport will be no issue. In this article I'm going to focus on the other potential pain points.

## How to pack

I know that some digital nomads out there travel with only hand luggage, for whom this section is irrelevant. I am not one of them. I carry about 15kg worth of stuff beyond my hand luggage, and while that might include things that don't seem essential to others (like my yoga mat and blocks, and my blender), I wouldn't want to live without them.

When you pack, the key thing to consider is it is far more likely that any checked baggage goes missing than it is any hand luggage, so in your hand luggage have the following:

- Any items of significant value
  - Most obviously, your laptop
- Any essential items
  - Your phone and charger are the obvious ones, debit/credit cards are another
- Any items it will be or may be necessary to have easy access to before you get to your next room
  - Passport(s), currency
- Any items that will make the journey more relaxing
  - Like a book or some headphones

In your checked baggage have everything else. All the items that, while it would be a pain and a small expense to have to replace them, won't cripple you if they go missing. I can live without my yoga mat if I have to. I can live without my blender. I can live without my five year old underwear and my t-shirts with holes in. In fact, the airline might be doing me a favour if it forces me to replace them.

While these are good general rules to follow, it's not quite that simple. Travelling is a game of hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, and while it's more likely your checked baggage goes missing than anything else, it's not the only possibility.

You could lose your hand luggage. If you're really unlucky, you could lose both. Get into the wrong taxi and the driver turns around and points a gun at you, telling you to get out and leave your bags, what about then?

When you pack, ask yourself three questions:

- Can I survive if I lose my checked baggage?
- Can I survive if I lose my hand luggage?
- Can I survive if I lose both?

You cannot prepare for all eventualities. Stories of people being robbed and stripped even of their clothes, left naked in the middle of nowhere, how do you prepare for that? Keep a debit card in your anus?

You don't, but you can still be as prepared as possible.

Any self-respecting digital nomad will have more ways of accessing their money than they're hopefully ever going to need. For example, I have five different physical debit cards, and on days I'm travelling, I carry two in my pockets (different pockets), two in my hand luggage (in different sections of my bag), and one in my checked baggage.

That way, if I get pick-pocketed, I still have three more cards, if I lose my hand luggage, I still have three more cards, if I lose my checked baggage, I still have four more cards, and if I lose all my bags, I still have two cards in my pockets.

Perhaps you lose your hand luggage including your passport(s), what then? As well as a photocopy of your passport, make sure to keep some secondary identification (such as a driver's licence) in your checked baggage. Something that you can show to local authorities to prove who you are.

You cannot prepare for all eventualities, but you can get as prepared for as many of them as possible, and pack your bags accordingly.

## Red tape

I'll assume that you now know the country you're leaving well enough that you can at least make it to the airport. Unless you've overstayed or done something else
