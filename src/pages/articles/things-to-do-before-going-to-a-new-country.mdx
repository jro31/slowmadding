While the hope is always for a smooth arrival when you go somewhere new, the world can be an unpredictable place. If your mobile network isn't working, or even worse you lose your phone altogether, are you prepared enough that you can get from the airport to your room? What about if you get an immigration officer who doesn't want to let you in? How can you give yourself the best chance? And do you know enough about the local currency to not get ripped-off?

This article will make sure you're prepared for as many eventualities as possible, in the event that things don't go as planned.

You might not believe this considering the lifestyle I've chosen, but I hate travelling. On a day when you travel from one location to another, your day goes something like:

- Check-out of your current room
- Go to the airport
- Check-in for your flight
- Go through immigration of the country you're leaving
- Take your flight
- Go through immigration of your new country
- Hope that the airline hasn't lost your bag
- Get to your new room
- Check-in to your new roomand you can be tripped-up at any one of those stages, depending on your luck for the day.

It's a miserable experience, but the pay-off for having such a day every few weeks or months, is that you get to spend your life in a constant state of flux, which makes it worth it. Just.

While things that should be simple, like checking-out of your current room, can trip you up (like when a hotel needs to return your deposit but there's no one at the desk all morning), there's not really much you can do to prepare for that, other than communicate well with your host, know the checkout procedure, and hope they're not a moron. And I'm going to assume that you're now familiar enough with the city that you're leaving that getting to the airport will be no issue. In this article I'm going to focus on the other potential pain points.

## Red tape

The world was not made for digital nomads. We're a spontaneous breed who go with the wind and change our plans on a whim.

Immigration rules are made by a bunch of dorks who sit around in offices and think that every second of a vacation should be planned in advance.

I could rant for hours about the ridiculousness of some of the hoops that you have to jump through, but it wouldn't change the fact that they exist. The quote Morpheus, immigration officials are the ones guarding all the doors and holding all the keys, and you're more often than not going to have to make a choice between adhering to these rules or hoping that they're not applied.

The rule that almost all countries have, and that bugs me more than any other, is that you must have an outbound flight in order to enter the country. It proves absolutely nothing, other than you can afford to buy a flight that you have no intention of taking, and removes any kind of spontaneity from your visit because to change the date or location of your departure is now accompanied by a large rearrangement or cancellation fee.

I think the logic is that if you at least have a flight paid for, then no matter what happens on your trip, you can at least leave the country again, but what guarantee is there that a person is actually going to be on their flight? None. Absolutley none.

Donkeys.

It annoys me to the point that I won't go to countries that require me to have an outbound flight in order to obtain a visa (I'm looking at you, Sri Lanka). In most cases, an outbound flight is a listed requirement that's rarely ever enforced. However, in the cases that it is, you want to be ready.

There are two possible pain points when not satisfying the entry requirements of a country. The obvious one is at immigration for that country, but the other is boarding your flight.

If a country denies you, as a passenger, entry, then the airline that brought you there is fined. That's why you're far more likely to be denied boarding by the airline, than you are to be denied entry by the immigration official.

What I will say, is that in both instances you're dealing with a human, and being polite and friendly can get you a long way. As an example, I've entered Thailand more times than I can remember, and on a total of zero of these occasions have I had the required flight out of the country.

I've only ever been asked about it once, and it was by the Thai immigration official. She asked me if I had an outbound flight, and I very honestly said _'no, I plan on leaving by land.'_ She looked up at me, smiled, stamped my passport and let me in.

The lessons here are:

- Don't be a prick
- Be prepared

The airline staff don't want to ruin your day, but they're well within their right to if you act like an arsehole. Their neck is on the line if the airline gets fined. Try to understand this. You don't know their situation, how long they've been in their job, and how important it is to them. Calmly explain to them why your don't have an outbound flight, and I'm yet to encounter an instance where I haven't been let through.

You should be prepared anyway. The night before your flight, go onto Skyscanner, look up a cheap outbound flight from your destination, and as a last resort, be prepared to buy it.

Immigration officials tend to care much less about entry requirements than airline staff, but the same rules apply. While airline staff have to be at least somewhat service-minded, immigration officials can be as much of a dick as they like and you have no recourse, so pander to their authority, have a good story lined-up as to why you don't have an outbound flight (this can be as simple as you don't know when you're going to leave, or that you plan on leaving by land to X country), and again as a last resort, be prepared to pony-up on an outbound flight you have no intention of taking.

Add it to the list of expenses for living this way.

## Money

This might sound obvious, but without money you're kind of fucked.

The obvious solution to this is to get some local currency for your destination before leaving, but this isn't always possible. The currency of some countries is just very hard to obtain outside its borders.

The primary hope, therefore, is that there will be an ATM in the airport that will accept your foreign card, you'll get some local currency and be on your way. And while this will be the case 95% of the time, be prepared for when it's not, otherwise your might be walking from the airport.

The first thing to research before going somewhere, is what type of economy is it? How do you typically pay for things? In the UK, for example, it's very much a card economy. Buses no longer accept cash, nor do many restaurants. The most antiquated way to pay is by card, and more commonly people will use Apple Pay or Google Pay. In many other economies cash is still king and cards are only accepted at big name businesses. Other countries are somewhere in between.

Last summer I spent five months in Europe, split between Romania, Bulgaria and Greece. On arrival in Romania I withdrew an equivalent of about £140, only to find that in all three countries, pretty much everywhere accepted card. Oddly enough, gyms didn't, which makes me think they're a front for money laundering.

On leaving Romania I exchanged my remaining Romanian lei to Bulgarian lev, and on leaving Bulgaria I exchanged my remaining lev to euros, and after nearly five months, I still hadn't spent this £140 because almost everywhere I went accepted cards. Had I done a bit more research, I'd have known not to bother withdrawing so much in Bucharest airport.

Once you've got a handle on how much cash you're actually going to need, try to find an ATM in the airport, although note that not all ATMs are created equal, and the fees and the withdrawal limits will vary between banks, so doing a bit of research beforehand can save you a few pennies.

So you've arrived in a new country, it's a cash economy, and no ATMs are accepting your cards, what then?

The one thing you should always carry on you is a small amount of US dollars (or euros if you're travelling in Europe). These should be crisp, clean, unfolded, undamaged notes. As they are not the local currency, damaged or even folded bills will not always be accepted.

You don't have to carry a lot, but having $50 can really save you in a pinch.

The first port of call should be to find an exchange kiosk within the airport. This is not ideal and you will not get a favourable exchange rate, however if it's a choice between that and walking from the airport, take the hit to your pocket.

If this isn't an option, for example if the airport doesn't have an exchange or you've arrived late at night and it's closed, go and talk to the local taxi drivers. Explain your situation, that you only have US dollars, and ask whether they'll accept them.

In most cases they will, but for a very, very unfavourable exchange rate. Again, preferable to walking from the airport.

While you're not exactly in a position of power, you should still negotiate as hard as possible. Regardless of if you have local currency or not, memorise the exchange rate, and make a little easy-reference table comparing the local currency to your home currency. This way you can easily understand how much something costs and have a better grasp of if someone's trying to pull the wool over your eyes.

For example, prior to my recent visit to Taiwan, I noted the following table comparing Taiwanese dollars to British pounds:

- NT$100 = £2.48
- NT$500 = £12.40
- NT$1,000 = £24.79
- NT$5,000 = £123.97

- £1 = NT$40.33
- £5 = NT$201.66
- £10 = NT$403.33
- £25 = NT$1,008.38
- £50 = NT$2,016.77

In all my years of backpacking, nomadding, and travelling of other kinds, I've never found myself in a situation where I needed to ask for help financially, but as an absolute last resort if you don't have any local currency, your ATM cards have all been lost, cancelled or aren't working, and you don't have any US dollars or any other currency anyone's willing to accept, there will be a way for someone to send you money. Western Union, for example.

I've never used this, so I won't speak any more on it. After which...

Hitch-hiking? It works in some countries. Maybe just start to cry and someone will take sympathy on you. The goal is to be prepared enough to any likely situation you face that it won't come to this.

## Getting to your room and getting connected

So you've got through immigration, you have all your bags, and you have some local currency in your pocket. There are two more things to consider - getting a mobile connection and getting to your room. And while most airports do offer kiosks selling local SIM cards nowadays, you're very rarely going to get a good deal at them as they mostly only offer tourist SIMs.

A tourist SIM is typically a short-term SIM card, that often cannot be extended or topped-up, of which the price is going to be more expensive than going to a phone shop in the city. I've never bought a SIM at the airport for these exact reasons, but that does mean that I'm therefore going to my room without a connection, so if you're playing this game, be sure that you have enough information to get to your room saved offline.

An example of where this went wrong for me, was when I went to Athens, I arrived at the airport and connected to the airport wifi, and using this connection I messaged my Airbnb host, who was to meet me at the room, telling them I'd be at the room in about an hour. They responded telling me that they'd meet me at the room.

An hour later, I arrived at the building but there was no host to be seen. They hadn't told me which room, or even which floor of this block of flats I was in, and with no connection I had no way of contacting them. What I had to do was wait until a resident came into the building, and sneak-in through the key card door before it closed behind them. I then had to walk up each floor of this block of flats, checking the wifi signals, until the wifi for the room that I was in came into range. Thankfully, it turned-out I was only on the fourth floor.

As I'd saved the wifi login details offline I was able to connect to my room's wifi, even though I didn't know which room it was, and from that I was able to message my host, who as it turns out, was waiting for me inside the room, he just hadn't bothered to tell me that or which room's doorbell I was supposed to ring.

We got there eventually, but having a connection (or better check-in instructions) beforehand would have made life much easier.

For the rest of this section I'm going to assume that you, like me, are going to be somewhere for several weeks or months, and therefore a tourist SIM isn't suitable and you're going to be travelling from the airport without a connection.

What do you need to do to make this journey smoother?
