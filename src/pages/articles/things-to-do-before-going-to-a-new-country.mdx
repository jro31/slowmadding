While the hope is always for a smooth arrival when you go somewhere new, the world can be an unpredictable place. If your mobile network isn't working, or even worse you lose your phone altogether, are you prepared enough that you can get from the airport to your room? What about if you get an immigration officer who doesn't want to let you in? How can you give yourself the best chance? And do you know enough about the local currency to not get ripped-off?

This article will make sure you're prepared for as many eventualities as possible, in the event that things don't go as smoothly as you hoped.

You might not believe this considering the lifestyle I've chosen, but I hate travelling. On a day when you travel from one location to another, your day goes something like:

- Check-out of your current room
- Go to the airport
- Check-in for your flight
- Go through immigration of the country you're leaving
- Take your flight
- Go through immigration of your new country
- Hope that the airline hasn't lost your bag
- Get to your new room
- Check-in to your new roomand you can be tripped-up at any one of those stages, depending on your luck for the day.

It's a miserable experience, but the pay-off for experiencing such a day every few weeks or months, is that you get to spend your life in a constant state of flux, which makes it worth it. Just.

While things that should be simple, like checking-out of your current room, can trip you up (like when a hotel needs to return your deposit but there's no one at the desk all morning), there's not really much you can do to prepare for that, other than communicate well with your hosts and know the checkout procedure. And I'm going to assume that you're now familiar enough with the city that you're leaving that getting to the airport will be no issue. In this article I'm going to focus on the other potential pain points.

## How to pack

I know that some digital nomads out there travel with only hand luggage, for whom this section is irrelevant. I am not one of them. I carry about 15kg worth of stuff beyond my hand luggage, and while that might include things that don't seem essential to others (like my yoga mat and blocks, and my blender), I wouldn't want to live without them.

When you pack, the key thing to consider is it is far more likely that any checked baggage goes missing than it is any hand luggage, so in your hand luggage have the following:

- Any items of significant value
  - Most obviously, your laptop
- Any essential items
  - Your phone and charger are the obvious ones, debit/credit cards are another
- Any items it will be or may be necessary to have easy access to before you get to your next room
  - Passport(s), currency
- Any items that will make the journey more relaxing
  - Like a book or some headphones

In your checked baggage have everything else. All the items that, while it would be a pain and a small expense to have to replace them, won't cripple you if they go missing. I can live without my yoga mat if I have to. I can live without my blender. I can live without my five year old underwear and my t-shirts with holes in. In fact, the airline might be doing me a favour if it forces me to replace them.

While these are good general rules to follow, it's not quite that simple. Travelling is a game of hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, and while it's more likely your checked baggage goes missing than anything else, it's not the only possibility.

You could lose your hand luggage. If you're really unlucky, you could lose both. Get into the wrong taxi and the driver turns around and points a gun at you, telling you to get out and leave your bags, what about then?

When you pack, ask yourself three questions:

- Can I survive if I lose my checked baggage?
- Can I survive if I lose my hand luggage?
- Can I survive if I lose both?

You cannot prepare for all eventualities. Stories of people being robbed and stripped even of their clothes, left naked in the middle of nowhere, how do you prepare for that? Keep a debit card in your anus?

You don't, but you can still be as prepared as possible.

Any self-respecting digital nomad will have more ways of accessing their money than they're hopefully ever going to need. For example, I have five different physical debit cards, and on days I'm travelling, I carry two in my pockets (different pockets), two in my hand luggage (in different sections of my bag), and one in my checked baggage.

That way, if I get pick-pocketed, I still have three more cards, if I lose my hand luggage, I still have three more cards, if I lose my checked baggage, I still have four more cards, and if I lose all my bags, I still have two cards in my pockets.

Perhaps you lose your hand luggage including your passport(s), what then? As well as a photocopy of your passport, make sure to keep some secondary identification (such as a driver's licence) in your checked baggage. Something that you can show to local authorities to prove who you are.

You cannot prepare for all eventualities, but you can get as prepared for as many of them as possible, and pack your bags accordingly.

## Red tape

The world was not made for digital nomads. We're a spontaneous breed who go with the wind and change our plans on a whim.

Immigration rules are made by a bunch of dorks who sit around in offices and think that every second of a vacation should be planned in advance.

I could rant for hours about the ridiculousness of some of the hoops that you have to jump through, but it wouldn't change the fact that the rules exist. The quote Morpheus, immigration officials are the ones guarding all the doors and holding all the keys, and you're more often than not going to have to make a choice between adhering to these rules or hoping that they're not applied.

The rule that almost all countries have, and that bugs me more than any other, is that you must have an outbound flight in order to enter the country. It proves absolutely nothing, other than the fact that you can afford to buy a flight that you have no intention of taking, and removes any kind of spontaneity from your visit because to change the date or location of your departure is now accompanied by a large rearrangement or cancellation fee.

I think the logic is that if you at least have a flight paid for, then no matter what happens on your trip, you can at least leave the country again, but what guarantee is there that a person is actually going to be on their flight? None. Absolutley none.

Donkeys.

It annoys me to the point that I won't go to countries that require me to have an outbound flight in order to obtain a visa (I'm looking at you, Sri Lanka). In most cases, an outbound flight is a listed requirement that's rarely ever enforced. However, in the cases that it is, you want to be ready.

There are two possible pain points when not satisfying the entry requirements of a country. The obvious one is at immigration for that country, but the other is on boarding your flight.

If a country denies you, as a passenger, entry, then the airline that brought you there is fined. That's why you're far more likely to be denied boarding by the airline, than you are to be denied entry into the country.

What I will say, is that in both instances you're dealing with a human, and being polite and friendly can get you a long way. As an example, I've entered Thailand more times than I can remember, and on a total of zero of these occasions, have I had a flight out of the country.

I've only ever been asked about it once, and it was by the Thai immigration official. She asked me if I had an outbound flight, and I very honestly said _'no, I plan on leaving by land.'_ She looked up at me, smiled, stamped my passport and let me in.

The lessons here are:

- Don't be a prick
- Be prepared

The airline staff don't want to ruin your day, but they're well within their right to if you act like an arsehole. Their neck is on the line if the airline gets fined. Try to understand this. You don't know their situation, and how important this job is to them. Calmly explain to them why your don't have an outbound flight, and I'm yet to encounter an instance where I haven't been let through. Yet be prepared anyway. The night before your flight, go onto Skyscanner, look up a cheap outbound flight from your destination, and as a last resort, be prepared to buy it.

Immigration officials tend to care much less about entry requirements than airline staff, but the same rules apply. While airline staff have to be at least somewhat service-minded, immigration officials can be as much of a dick as they like and you have no recourse, so pander to their authority, have a good story lined-up as to why you don't have an outbound flight (this can be as simple as you don't know when you're going to leave, or that you plan on leaving by land to X country), and again as a last resort, be prepared to pony-up on an outbound flight you have no intention of taking.

Add it to the list of expenses for living this way.
