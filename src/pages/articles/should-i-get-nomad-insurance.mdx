Before I answer that question, I should reveal that as far as I'm concerned there is only one reason to buy nomad insurance: To cover your costs in a medical emergency.

Policies can cover all kinds of other things like flight delays and cancellations, lost luggage, theft etc. While the costs of these can be an annoyance, if you don't have the savings to swallow such costs should they arise, then you may want to re-think being a nomad to begin with.

This is an unpredictable lifestyle with unpredictable occurances. To alleviate stress when the unexpected happens, you should have the funds to replace every item you own a couple of times over, and as such, insurance for minor events like an airline losing your bags is really a person choice.

What I care about, is incurring crippling and life-changing medical bills because you got into an accident and didn't have the insurance to cover it.

For example, I once worked with a guy in Bangkok, who'd gone up to the north of the country, got into a motorcycle accident, and spent weeks in hospital in a coma. When he finally woke-up, he was greeted with bills equalling hundreds of thousands of pounds, and he wasn't permitted to leave the hospital until it was paid.

To do this, his parents had to remortgage their house and he became forever indebted to them.

When I ask the question _"should I get nomad insurance?"_ it is for that one, specific instance of crippling costs arrising from a medical emergency while abroad.

And while the obvious answer is _"yes,"_ that is the safer option, can you even be certain that the insurance company will pay-out? When you buy a policy, are you really sure that you're covered? And given it costs hundreds or sometimes thousands of pounds to buy something that you're unlikely to ever use, is it really a good use of your funds?
