Chiang Rai is largely avoided by tourists. Or those that do come here, just give it a day or two as an aside from Chiang Mai, in order to visit the famed white temple, but few come to Chiang Rai as the destination in itself. A mistake which allows it to retain its small-town charm.

It’s a very modest, peaceful place. Tourism hasn’t gripped it with any significance. Nor has capitalism.

Apart from 7-11 (of which there are fewer than in other parts of Thailand), you see few, if any chain businesses in Chiang Rai. Instead, most places you go are small businesses; family-run or with just one or two employees.

It’s what the world would be like if you could rid greed from humanity. Early stage capitalism where people trade fairly with those around them, with no one getting rich and taking more than their share.

That equality breeds a population who are just content. As such, Chiang Rai is a wonderful place to simply be. To wander the streets and exist peacefully.

That doesn’t mean that the locals will join you. Like everywhere in Thailand, the locals are allergic to walking, and ride motorcycles to get anywhere, but the roads aren’t overcrowded with vehicles. You can comfortably walk down the side of a road without a pavement, with little fear of being rundown.

The tourism that does exist in Chiang Rai starts on Jetyod Road, and quickly dissipates as you spread-out from there.

There you can find a few bars, restaurants, dispensaries and massage parlours hoping to part tourists with their money. Once you get away from that tourist centre, you’ll find very little English, which for me was great because for everything from getting my laundry done to buying water, I was forced to use my very limited Thai.

Being a small city so far from Bangkok, you get to benefit from a significantly lower cost of living compared to being in the capital, which if you’re earning a static income no matter where in the world you are, allows you to really live without considering the cost.

There aren’t many places in the world where I feel comfortable buying things without looking at the price, but I got so used to the low cost and the honest locals that I didn’t really pay attention to money here.

For example, getting my laundry done would cost me 130 to 150 baht. For an equivalent load in Bangkok I was paying 300 to 350 baht.

To visit a western restaurant in the capital, you can easily expect to pay over 400 baht for a meal with a drink. An equivalent meal in a western restaurant in Chiang Rai is closer to 200 baht.

You can get a two-hour Thai massage in Chiang Rai for 300 baht. In Bangkok the best you can hope for is 400 baht, but usually it’ll be more than that.

And I could continue down the list through accommodation and transport to beer and clothes.

## Where to get vegan food in Chiang Rai

Veganism isn't as common in Thailand as you might expect for a Buddhist country. So in less touristy cities, such as Chiang Rai, vegan offerings can be few and far between. That's especially true if you lack the Thai to order vegan food at the local restaurants.

So if you've been spoiled by the gluttony of vegan restaurants in tourist hubs like Bangkok and Chiang Mai, it might initially be a bit of a shock how little is obviously on offer in Chiang Rai. However once you settle down and explore a bit, you realise that Chiang Rai does have quite a few good offerings.

Searching for vegan food on delivery apps like Grab and FoodPanda is an alternative choice, even if you have no intention of ordering from the app.

Chiang Rai's vegan offerings go far beyond what I'll mention here, but my favourite places were:
