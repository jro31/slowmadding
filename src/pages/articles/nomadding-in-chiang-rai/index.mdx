Chiang Rai is largely avoided by tourists. Or those that do come here, just give it a day or two as an aside from Chiang Mai, in order to visit the famed white temple, but few come to Chiang Rai as the destination in itself. A mistake which allows it to retain its small-town charm.

It's a very modest, peaceful place. Tourism hasn't gripped it with any significance. Nor has capitalism.

Apart from 7-11 (of which there are fewer than in other parts of Thailand), you see few, if any chain businesses in Chiang Rai. Instead, most places you go are small businesses; family-run or with just one or two employees.

It's what the world would be like if you could rid greed from humanity. Early stage capitalism where people trade fairly with those around them, with no one getting rich and taking more than their share.

That equality breeds a population who are just content. As such, Chiang Rai is a wonderful place to simply be. To wander the streets and exist peacefully.

That doesn't mean that the locals will join you. Like everywhere in Thailand, the locals are allergic to walking, and ride motorcycles to get anywhere, but the roads aren't overcrowded with vehicles. You can comfortably walk down the side of a road without a pavement, with little fear of being rundown.

The tourism that does exist in Chiang Rai starts on Jetyod Road, and quickly dissipates as you spread-out from there.

There you can find a few bars, restaurants, dispensaries and massage parlours hoping to part tourists with their money. Once you get away from that tourist centre, you'll find very little English, which for me was great because for everything from getting my laundry done to buying water, I was forced to use my very limited Thai.

Being a small city so far from Bangkok, you get to benefit from a significantly lower cost of living compared to being in the capital, which if you're earning a static income no matter where in the world you are, allows you to really live without considering the cost.

There aren't many places in the world where I feel comfortable buying things without looking at the price, but I got so used to the low cost and the honest locals that I didn't really pay attention to money here.

For example, getting my laundry done would cost me 130 to 150 baht. For an equivalent load in Bangkok I was paying 300 to 350 baht.

To visit a western restaurant in the capital, you can easily expect to pay over 400 baht for a meal with a drink. An equivalent meal in a western restaurant in Chiang Rai is closer to 200 baht.

You can get a two-hour Thai massage in Chiang Rai for 300 baht. In Bangkok the best you can hope for is 400 baht, but usually it'll be more than that.

And I could continue down the list through accommodation and transport to beer and clothes.

## Where to get vegan food in Chiang Rai

TODO: Add fruit market

Veganism isn't as common in Thailand as you might expect for a Buddhist country, so in less touristy cities such as Chiang Rai, vegan offerings can be few and far between. That's especially true if you lack the Thai to order vegan food at the local restaurants.

So if you've been spoiled by the gluttony of vegan restaurants in tourist hubs like Bangkok and Chiang Mai, it might initially be a bit of a shock how little is obviously on offer in Chiang Rai. However once you settle down and explore a bit, you realise that Chiang Rai does have quite a few good offerings.

<ExternalLink url="https://www.happycow.net/searchmap?s=3&location=Chiang+Rai%2C+Thailand&metric=mi&limit=81&order=rating&lat=19.9072&lng=99.831&zoom=11&page=1">Happy Cow</ExternalLink> is my go-to resource for finding vegan food in most places in the world, and Chiang Rai is no different. Searching for vegan food on local delivery apps like Grab and FoodPanda is an alternative choice. Even if you have no intention of ordering from the app, it can let you know which places offer vegan food.

Vegan food in Chiang Rai goes far beyond what I'll mention here, but my favourite places were:

### Kunda Vegan Vegetarian

One word comes to mind when I think of Kunda: Clean. And I'm not talking about the premesis.

Chef Lena has a passion for cooking plant-based food that you can sense when you come here. She'll be very open to telling you about the menu the moment you walk through the door, and will tell you about how each ingredient is made on site.

I initially thought the menu looked overpriced when I saw that a burger without any sides starts at 250 baht. After that burger, it felt worth every penny.

The burger, the bun, even the sauce is homemade with love. And when you eat clean food, you just feel better.

### Veg Me Up

This is juice bar/smoothie bowl cafe, rather than a restaurant. But it makes my list of vegan restaurants in Chiang Rai, just because it was the best place I found to get a my fix of fruit.

I like to eat a good amount of fruit daily, but at the very least on every other day. There are street vendors sporadically dotted around Chiang Rai selling the usual fruits such as pineapple, watermelon and papaya. But when you're in the mood for something a little more, Chiang Rai could leave you lacking.

Except for Veg Me Up.

Beware that it's not fully vegan. By my count, four of the six smoothie bowls and seven of the eight juices are vegan (the others contain honey or Nutella). And despite the menu saying _"We use only Almond Milk"_, they offer smoothie yogurts that are made with cow milk, so it does feel slightly misleading. Luckily the staff speak good English, so query anything you're uncertain about. And definitely don't let that put you off, because this is the best place that I found in Chiang Rai to get your fruit fix.

The smoothie bowls are 185 baht, and the juices are 80 baht each.

## Where to run in Chiang Rai

When I arrived in Chiang Rai, I asked someone where the best places to run were. What she told me was Singha Park, 25 minutes from town, or the old airport in town.

Although Singha Park looked great, I don't have my own transport, and I like running to be as simple as possible. If I can start running as soon as I step out my front door, then that's perfect. The fewer barriers there are, the more likely I am to run.

Looking at a map, the old airport was just a 15-minute walk from my room.

I walked down there to do a bit of recon and... man, that looks perfect, so the next day I gave it a go. And it really is a great place to run.

I'll add the caveat that I have a slightly sadomasochistic attitude to running. I see it as a time work and to push yourself. You only know what you're capable of when you push yourself, both physically and mentally, until you reach your limits and all you have to do to make the pain go away, is to stop running. That's when you feel alive, so unlike most people, when I'm in this region I prefer to run at the hotter times of day.

From what I saw when walking by at other times, the airport gets busy in the early mornings before it gets hot, and even more so in the evenings, so beware that you won't be running alone if you choose those times.

From mid-morning until the late afternoon though, you have pretty much the entire airport to yourself.

And by airport, what I mean is the runway for this former airport is still entirely in tact but completely abandoned, so is essentially a very long and straight park that anyone can wander onto and use as they see fit.

Vehicles aren't allowed, and this is largely adhered to, so you can run without concern.

According to Strava from my runs here, one lap of the runway is about 3.4km, which means that from one end of the runway to the other is just over a mile, so it's a good length track. And predictably for a runway, there are no trees or other shade, so you're completely at the mercy of the sun, which gives the run a little extra pep on warmer days.

I was so happy running here that it was the only place that I ran in Chiang Rai, so I can't comment on anywhere else. I'm sure more adventurous souls will be able to find alternative spots.

However, if you want a big, open space, void of vehicles, within the city itself, this is exactly what you're looking for.

## Being sociable in Chiang Rai

The whole reason that I opted to come to Chiang Rai, was that after a month in Bangkok and two weeks in Chiang Mai, I wanted a bit of a cleanse of all the tourism. So I didn't come here with the intention of being sociable.

Which was lucky, because the lack of opportunities to be sociable is perhaps the one downside of being here.

I'm not someone who's really confident enough to make conversations with strangers. Particularly when sober. So for me to meet people, I do much better at events designed with that purpose.

In Bangkok there's an endless line of Meetup events and Facebook groups exactly for that purpose. In Chiang Mai, Meetup, but there's still a good collection of events that you can find on Facebook.

Chiang Rai has none of that. I really couldn't find anything that interested me.

That's not to say there aren't places. I'm sure that doing a tour to the various temples would be a good way to meet people, as would doing cooking classes or learning Thai here.

None of those things interested me during my time in Chiang Rai, so I found it to be a largely solitary experience.

I met one person off Tinder, and as the World Cup was going on during my stay, went to a bar for one of the games, where I got chatting to people.

If I'm honest, I think that was about as far as my social life went while I was here.

If you're a fairly introverted person, but you still like to be sociable, then coming to Chiang Rai alone maybe isn't for you.

It's more a place to come if you're comfortable in your own company. Which I luckily am. But do be aware of that before you read everything else I've written book a month up here.

If you're coming alone, make sure you're comfortable in your own company.
