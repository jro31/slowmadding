If you spend any amount of time on a digital nomad forum (and I strongly recommend that you don't), you'll see complaint, after complaint, after complaint about Airbnb. People sitting at their keyboard aren't generally known for their positivity, so you have to take this with a grain of salt, and how many digital nomads on digital nomad forums are actually digital nomads? Given the quality of content that gets posted, I would suspect not too many. All that being said, I'm sure that some of these complaints are genuine. As my experience with using Airbnb to find accommodation has been overwhelmingly positive, I want to detail the process that I go through to choose the place that I stay, because it's working really well for me.

## Things to consider

Before getting down to choosing a specific room, are a couple of things I recommend considering.

### Get in early

If I'm staying in an Airbnb, it'll typically be for a month or longer. When you're staying somewhere for that long, all it takes is one person booking one night during those dates, and a room isn't going to show up in your search results. Leaving it until the last minute to find a place to stay, you're going to be left with the places that no one else wanted.

In my backpacking days, pre-smartphone, I'd often show up in some town and wander around the hostels until I found somewhere I wanted to stay. That's great as a backpacker, but being a digital nomad is different. It's your responsibility to surround yourself with the infrastructure that you need in order to do your job. If you're in any way limited compared to how you'd be in a steady location, then you're not doing it right.

How early in advance you should book depends on where you're going, what the season is, and how much is available, but typically I'll aim to book a couple of months in advance.

Cancellation policies vary by room, but typically if you cancel a month before your booking you'll get a full refund, so it's worth locking-in a place early so that you know that you have somewhere good to stay, and cancelling later on if you need to.

### Don't discount the monthly discount

When I first started living as a digital nomad, I stayed in each place I went for roughly two weeks. It was only on wandering around Chiang Mai one day that I saw an illuminated sign outside an apartment block that said _"One night, 600 baht. One month, 6,000 baht."_ I stood there looking at that sign for a minute, and was like... damn. If you're staying for eleven nights, it's cheaper to just pay for an entire month than pay night-by-night.

I was planning on going to Phnom Penh at this time, and when I went back to my room, I went onto Airbnb and looked at one of the rooms I'd been considering.

I put my intended dates in as 16th December to 12th January (27 nights), and it came up as a total cost of £857.61. I then changed the dates to 16th December to 13th January (28 nights). The total cost was £497.89.

The monthly discount that you get varies by apartment and is dependent on the host. Some will offer no monthly discount, others up to 45%. I will typically disregard rooms that don't offer at least 25%, because you'll be able to get better value elsewhere.

You're making the host's life very easy by committing to pay for that room every night for an entire month, where as their usual reality would be a couple of nights booked, a couple of nights empty, a couple of nights booked etc., having to arrange cleaning and check-in and check-out for each guest that stays. You deserve a hefty discount for that.

## How to choose a room

You should obviously tailor this process for your own wants and needs, and how many rooms are available in the town/city that you're going to. On the assumption I'm going somewhere with plenty of choice, I select a room by doing the following.

### Select the area

The first thing you need to decide is which area of the city that you want to stay in. How do you do that if you've never been somewhere before?

My strategy for doing this may seem a little absurd, but it's consistently worked for me. The first thing that I do it go onto <ExternalLink url='https://www.happycow.net/'>Happy Cow</ExternalLink>. Happy Cow is an app for finding vegan/vegetarian food, and is the biggest database of vegan/vegetarian restaurants I've ever encountered. I'll search for the city that I'm planning on going to, and on the results page will filter to just show vegan restaurants. This will show a map of all the vegan restaurants in the city; or at least close to the centre of the city.

I'll zero my Airbnb search onto any areas of the city that have clusters of vegan restaurants. Why?

The first and most obvious reason is I'm vegan, and I want to easily be able to get food when I go somewhere. Particularly on working days, when I want to be able to get some quick food on my lunchbreak, having a nearby vegan restaurant makes life much, much easier, especially if I don't have the means to cook for myself.

The second, less obvious reason, is that veganism is still a somewhat progressive concept. You don't get many vegans, and hence many vegan restaurants, in very working class areas, or very conservative areas. You get them in more chilled-out hipster areas, and in my experience, those areas are safer and more pleasant to stay-in.

I also really value green, open space. This is partly because I think it's important to surround yourself with nature as much as you can and going and sitting in the park is a nice thing to do, and partly because I like to run, and parks are the best place to do that. So within the hister areas that I identified on Happy Cow, I'll go onto Google Maps, and look for any decent-sized parks. Looking at the parks in street view can give you a pretty good idea of what kind of park it is.

### Search on Airbnb

It's only once I've identified the area that I want to stay in that I'll actually go onto Airbnb.

You obviously want to search for the city, dates and number of guests that you want, but beyond that I add the following filters to my search:

- I search just for homes - I have no interest in shared accommodation.
- I'll set the maximum price to what I'm willing to pay - I typically try to spend less than £1,200/month on accommodation, although I'll raise/lower this depending on the price of the city I'm looking at.
- I only search for Superhosts - You can read about what it takes to become a Superhost <ExternalLink url='https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/829/'>here</ExternalLink>, but essentially Superhosts are hosts who regularly have happy guests staying with them, so you can have less concern that you're going to be renting from someone problematic.
- If I'm booking a long way in advance, I might also filter just places that offer free cancellation.

I'll then go to the map view of the results and zoom-into the area that I previously identified as being the area that I want to stay in.

### Favourite the best places

There may only be a small number of rooms available, but there may still be dozens, in which case I'll quickly go over all the results, and 'favourite' any that I want to come back to. To 'favourite' a room, click or tap the little heart that appears on Airbnb. You'll be asked which 'wishlist' you wish to save it to. I create a new wishlist for each location I look at, so if I was looking for a room in Athens, I'd name this wishlist 'Athens'.

How I quickly decide which rooms I want to 'favourite', is firstly I look at the current rating. This is the aggregated score that previous guests have given this room. How fussy you can be here depends on how many rooms are available, but I'll typically only save rooms with a rating of 4.8 (out of 5) or higher. I also favour rooms that have a higher number of guest reviews. I generally won't consider a room that doesn't have at least five, and ideally like to see it have fifteen or more. If a room has fifteen ratings and they average out at 4.95 or higher, you can be pretty confident that you're staying at a good place.

Beyond the ratings, I'll skim-over the property description, the photos and the reviews and eliminate any others that aren't what I'm looking for.

The number of saved rooms you end up with obviously depends on how stringent you're being and how many there are available, but I'd say that having about 10 to 12 rooms here is a good number. You want to give youself a bit of a choice, but too many is also a pain to have to sift through, so if you find yourself with twenty saved rooms, go back over and remove the ones with the lowest ratings. Once you're down to 10 to 12 places move onto the next section.

### Look up the rooms in detail

By only saving Superhost rooms that have lots of positive reviews, you can be pretty confident that the rooms on the list that you have in front of you are all good places to stay, so at this point you need to determine which room is right **for you**.
