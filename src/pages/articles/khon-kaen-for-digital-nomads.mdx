### Real Vegan

I'm slightly confused by the name of this place as it seems to be known as both 'Real Vegan' and as 'Tawanthong Vegetarian Food'. There are a couple of businesses here, so perhaps one name is for the restaurant, the other for the shop. Regardless, I'm going to refer to it just as Real Vegan, as this was the most prominent signage I saw.
