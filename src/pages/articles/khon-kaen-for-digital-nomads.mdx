Khon Kaen is a city that, for most, isn't on their itinerary for Thailand. It's one of Isaan's big four cities, located both geographically and characteristically between Udon Thani and Nakhon Ratchasima. Where as Udon has a nascent but noticable tourist presence, Nakhon Ratchasima has little to offer foreigners beyond a local experience, Khon Kaen lands somewhere in the middle.

You will see other foreigners here and there is a small (and I do mean small) area of foreigner-aimed bars, but in the main it's a city that most visitors to Thailand don't have a reason to stop in, and for me that's a mistake.

The only regret from my week here is I didn't choose to stay longer, because I really loved it and would have relished more time to get to know the city.

It's a deceptively vegan-friendly place, with even one western-style vegan restaurant, which I really wasn't expecting in the middle of Isaan. There are some big night markets that are fun for exploring, as well as providing a useful source of food. There's a large reservoir that has a path going all the way around the outside that makes for a lovely place to walk and run. It's safe, it's incredibly affordable, the Internet is fast and reliable, it's fairly pleasant to walk around, the people are friendly and the small foreigner-aimed bar area gives you somewhere fun to go in the evenings.

Save for being in a major tourist city, Khon Kaen really offers everything that you look for as a digital nomad. As long as you're comfortable with isolation (which you really should be living this lifestyle), then I can't recommend Khon Kaen enough.

## Where to get vegan food in Khon Kaen

There's good news and there's bad news when it comes to getting vegan food in Khon Kaen.

The good news is that it's a surprisingly vegan-friendly city. Mostly it's Thai food, but it goes slightly beyond the typical เจ (jay) buffets because you can also get vegan food made to order and there's even a small (almost) vegan supermarket, as I'll get to below. There's also one western-style vegan restaurant.

The bad news is that apart from Kem-Kon, everything closes by 7pm, so in terms of getting dinner, it's not a very vegan-friendly city, so make sure you have a big lunch.

There's one Subway restaurant in town which is open late (9pm) and at the time of writing offers a plant-based chicken sandwich. I don't recommend it, I've never eaten a Subway and felt good about my life, but it's there as a last resort for when you need dinner.

### Su Ting Sian

My favourite restaurant in Khon Kaen, Su Ting Sian is a fully-vegan restaurant with a menu in English and Thai and pictures for a lot of the items. The incredible friendly staff don't speak much English, but pointing at the menu is sufficient.

It has several tables inside to sit at. Sadly it's not air conditioned, but there are many fans so it feels pretty cool in the restaurant, and it's always quiet so you can pick a table right in front of a fan.

The portion sizes are massive, and closing at 4pm each day I'd often come here for a late lunch, get two meals and skip dinner because it was enough to last me until bed. It's almost exclusively Thai food on the menu, which I recommend you stick to, because it's really high quality. The one non-Thai dish that I had (spaghetti) was... interesting. No shortage of sauce.

### Kem-Kon Khon Kaen

Kem-Kon Khon Kaen was the restaurant I wasn't expecting in Khon Kaen. It's a western-style vegan restaurant like I'd expect to find in Bangkok, not in the middle of Isaan.

That's the good news. The bad news is the location really sucks. I'm someone who walks everywhere I go when I stay somewhere. I hate taking taxis or motorcycle taxis (unless I'm drunk), and I hate getting food delivered. So I walked to Kem-Kon, and it's way outside the city centre, taking me about an hour to walk to from my hotel, in an almost industrial area at the side of the main road.

That's the reason that I only made it here once during my stay, and why it's not so viable for dinner, despite being open until 10pm each night. I wouldn't want to walk down the side of that road after dark.

Or you could just take a taxi here like a normal person.

That aside, it's a great place. I'd have been here everyday were it in the city centre. While the restaurant itself is very much styled as a western restaurant, the menu has a mix of Thai and foreign dishes, dominated by the Thai offerings. It's fully-vegan so you can order here with impunity from dishes such as garlicky chicken with rice (85 baht), cashew cheese lasagna (195 baht) and butter grilled seafood (155 baht).

Even though the location sucks, it's worth the walk out here.

### Real Vegan

I'm slightly confused by the name of this place as it seems to be known as both 'Real Vegan' and as 'Tawanthong Vegetarian Food'. There are a couple of businesses here, so perhaps one name is for the restaurant, the other for the shop. Regardless, I'm going to refer to it just as Real Vegan, as this was the most prominent signage I saw.

The first of the two businesses here is the typical Thai เจ buffet that you get everywhere in Thailand, although I'd say this one is pretty high quality. These buffets can be a bit hit-and-miss, and I liked everything I ate here. As is customary with such restaurants, it stops serving each day at 2pm, so you really want to be here by 12:30pm to ensure there's a good selection of food left.

The second business, and the reason that I really loved this place, is it houses what is probably the best shop for getting vegan food I've encountered anywhere, particularly on this side of the world. Stumbling upon it in Khon Kaen of all places is something I really didn't expect, but I was in heaven.

Beware that despite having a big sign saying 'Real Vegan', this shop isn't actually quite vegan. There are many products that contain honey, and I noticed one that quite subtly contained milk, so perhaps they were stocking it in error. Apart from that it's aisles of vegan produce, including a great selection of nuts and seeds (great for smoothies and for getting snacks, particularly for long bus journeys) and it has two aisles of just tea.

Tea is one of the things that I really struggle to buy in Thailand, because the major supermarkets only stock very over-priced imported teas. When you can find it, Thailand has some amazing local teas but they're often only available in local shops and being new in town, I often don't know where to go.

Finding this place was my own personal heaven. I bought enough tea that I'm still drinking it four weeks and two locations later.

While the restaurant closes at 2pm, the shop is open until 6pm each day. If you have a kitchen this place will be even better, but even if you don't, there's enough healthy, vegan snacky food here that you can get supplies to last you through the Khon Kaen daily fast, once all the restaurants have closed.
