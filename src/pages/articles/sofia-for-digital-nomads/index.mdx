You know who the worst people in the world are?

Optimists. And Nazis, but mostly optimists. Their entire lives are spent disappointed things didn't live up to their expectations. Unyielding pessimism is the only way to ensure that life endless stream of pleasant surprises.

I was unacharacteristically optimistic about coming to Sofia. My whole process for deciding where I go, is out of the places I can afford, I look at a map and go to the ones I have the best feelings about, and I just had a good feeling about Bulgaria. I think because in other regions of the world, the "sick child" of that region has always been a place I've loved.

In South America, Bolivia is the poorest, least developed country, looked down upon by its neighbours, but I absolutely loved it. Spent three months there before going to Argentina, and Argentina can fuck off. In south-east Asia it's Laos. It's landlocked, it's poor, it has Thailand to the south and China to the north. I loved it there too. And based on the reactions from when I told people I was coming, I saw Bulgaria as the sick child of the EU, and in my human desire to cheer for the underdog, I optimisically arrived in Sofia, and that can never leave to anything good.

It was late afternoon when my bus pulled-into the bus station. I caught the Metro to my Airbnb without talking to anyone and did a self check-in, quickly put my bags down and went out and got food, then went to a phone shop to buy a SIM card. This was at the store of one of Bulgaria's three networks, right in the middle of the touristy city centre, so presumably visited by many a tourist wanting to get connected as soon as they arrive in the city.

The night before I'd been online and read that a SIM would cost me 15 lev. When I told the girl I wanted to buy a SIM, she quoted me _"21 lev," which was more than I was expecting, but I'd been sat on a bus all day. I couldn't be arsed to question it. I paid her 21 lev, and she gave me this SIM and a little stand for my phone, which I assumed they were giving away as a freebie.

It was only back at my room did I inspect the receipt to see that the SIM had cost 15 lev. The phone stand, which hadn't been mentioned at all, was charged separately for 6 lev more. After the girl that'd served me in the restaurant, this was quite literally the second person I'd interacted with in Bulgaria, and she'd scammed me out of an insignificant sum of money, but scammed me all the same which instantly moved me from a place of optimism, to a place of apprehension about whether I could trust people here. As much as I tried to rid it from my mind, I'm not sure Sofia ever recovered match my expectations prior to arrival.

If you've ever worked in customer service, you'll know that 99% of people are lovely, but it just takes one to ruin your day. My feeling about Sofia is that 99% of people here are lovely and friendly and honest, but there's 1% that just aren't. For me at least, being on the receiving end any amount of animosity, however small, sticks with me. On another day I came out of my room. There was a guy out there in a hi-viz jacket who asked me something in Bulgarian. When I asked (in English) if he spoke English, he just looked at me angrily and started muttering under his breath as he walked away. Or there was this guy I encountered in the park, clearly drunk or on something who stumbled out of a bush without looking, right into my path. When he did notice me, he quickly changed course and went around me, but to demostrate his displeasure, loudly spat on the ground behind me.

Minor confrontations like this, they happen. They're a part of life. I just feel like they happen a bit more in Sofia.

## Where I stayed

### Luxury Apart Sofia Center

<AccommodationTable details={apartmentDetails} />

Evolution: "I've spent 3.5 billion years perfecting a biological rhythm where people rise and sleep with daylight."

Humans: "Lol."

This apartment is on the ground floor. I typically avoid ground floor rooms for security reasons, but there are decorative bars here sufficient to mitigate any risk of someone climbing through the windows, and the door looks like it could guard Fort Knox. From a security perspective, this room is as safe as anywhere I've stayed. From a privacy perspective it's less so.

On the plus side the room is on the rear side of the building, so you don't have to worry about people peering in as they wander down the street. On the negative side, it's next to a restaurant and all the staff take their smoke breaks out the back, and should you leave the curtains open, they can watch you lying in bed.

Human beings have created some dumb inventions before, but perhaps the dumbest of them all is black-out curtains: Disrupting your circadian rhythm since World War II. Save for some largely transparent drapes, this room only has black-out curtains. And as someone who likes to get as much daylight as possible, it was a constant battle between closing the curtains enough that I had some privacy, but not closing them so much that it disrupted my ability to rise with daylight.

Save for the crippling loneliness, despondency and endless longing for it to all be over, the great thing about being alone is that you get to have an entire bed to yourself. I don't have a side of the bed, I always just sleep in the middle so when I stay somewhere with an alleged double-bed, but it's actually two single mattresses, then God can go fuck himself. I don't know who thinks that's a good idea. Why would you want to sleep in the same bed as someone but be forced to be on different sides of it? If that's what you want then just sleep in different beds. Or different rooms. Or just get a divorce and stop this facade.

The room is a studio, which had I paid more attention when booking, I would have realised. Studios are only really bad things when you're with someone else and you have nowhere to get away from them. Again touting the benefits of soul-crushing desolation, when you're in a studio by yourself, it can be better than having a one-bedroom because you get the same amount of space without all the walls getting in the way.

That's not really the case here, it's actually quite small, but it can be.

There is room to comfortably do yoga, which is all the space that I actually need. Anymore is just being greedy, and you have this much space despite also having a dining table with two chairs, and armchair, a desk with an office chair, and a double bed that some nobhead put two mattresses on.

The kitchen area is a bit lacking. It has an induction hob that you can unplug and put in a drawer when you're not using it. I used to think they were a poor alternative to having a permanent cooker, but having used them in multiple Airbnbs now, I actually think they're an improvement. You can take them out and plug them in whenever you want to cook, but the rest of the time you put them away and can use that space as a surface.

How much better would so many kitchens be if you could use the cooker space as a surface?

It also has a microwave-grill, which I'd never head of until I'd stayed here. It's a microwave and a grill. Together. A microwave-grill.

No, I don't know who came up with that either. Probably the same person who invented blackout curtains. I found some minimal use for it by getting some baguettes from the nearby Lidl and toasting them in it, but it definitely wasn't adequate replacement for an oven.

The first thing I look for when choosing an Airbnb, and the reason that I never pay much attention to the details of the room, is the location. I want the room to be in a good location, which for me means it has four things nearby: Somewhere to run, a gym, vegan food and a supermarket. For as much as it could be anywhere in Sofia, this room is in a perfect location.

My favourite vegan restaurant here, Edgy Veggy, is a 150 metre walk, and Neeko is only a 450m walk. My gym, <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/MmdptJZ48y9R8Drw8'>Silver Gym</ExternalLink> is a 250m walk. Lidl is a 550m walk, with additional supermarkets not much further. And while you can confortably run right out the front door, the north-west corner of the National Palace of Culture Park is only a 350m walk.

The gym was so close that I walked there in my workout clothes. I'd go straight from the gym to Edgy Veggy, which conveniently sold protein shakes you could have with your lunch, and I could be back at my room in an hour. The location was amazing, and made-up for the frustrations of the room, however slight they were.

## Where to run in Sofia

In my month in Bucharest prior to coming here, I got back into interval running. That's short bursts of high-speed running, rather than long, slow runs as people typically do. My hope before coming here was that I would continue doing at least some interval running, but what that requires is a flat, even, unimpeded surface, preferably in a loop.

Looking at a map you'll see that Sofia has several parks. Nearest to my room was the <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/Vf1xbR1S9pSpBwn37'>National Palace of Culture Park</ExternalLink>. I wasn't expecting much from this, but a little further on is South Park. Carry on going, and you get to another park, also called South Park. I wonder why they couldn't think of any other names.

To differentiate between them I'm going to refer to them as <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/FVzLkyp1frUZ3WUx7'>north South Park</ExternalLink> and as <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/2nzsSinFvwNFFDFZ9'>south South Park</ExternalLink>.

My hope prior to coming to Sofia was that north South Park would be a good place to do faster runs. The reason that it's not, isn't that it's not big enough or flat enough. It's that all the paths just go straight across the park, so you can't actually do any loops without diverting over stretches of grass that are pretty uneven under-foot. I tried to do a fast run here when I first arrived, and I just couldn't do it. And yes, I am blaming the unevenness of the grass, and not my lack of fitness or willpower for why I got such a shit time.

From that I concluded that Sofia is better for longer, slower runs, for which it is really good. The pavements and roads are quiet enough that you can comfortably run down the street, but with a bit of planning you can do some decent-length runs mostly in parkland.

I started by combining National Palace of Culture Park with north South Park and south South Park, but later graduated onto including <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/irA1U3acEKrzqe9P8'>Borisova Gradina Park</ExternalLink>, which turned it into a 12km loop where almost all of Borisova Gradina Park, and the south half of south South Park are some pretty isolated trails. It was really enjoyable, with the only downside being that they're so winding that keeping your bearings is near impossible. I often found myself stopping to check the map on my watch, only to see I was going in the opposite direction to what I thought.

On my last run in Sofia, I was going down one of these isolated, winding trails only to come across an old man lying on the path. I stopped, and on the assumption he didn't speak English put my thumb up and asked him _"ok?"_

_"Help,"_ was his response in a very timid voice. He didn't seem to know any other words, but when he started trying to stand up, I pulled him off the ground and had to hold him steady for about twenty seconds, lest he go back down again. He was carrying a crutch and had a bandage around one leg, which made me wonder if going on walks down isolated, uneven trails was the best thing for him. He could have been there for hours, and had I not come along, might have been for many more.

His dog didn't give a fuck. He was just chilling. Forget Lassie, that dog wasn't going to do shit.

If you are intent on doing faster runs, on the right if you enter south South Park from the north, is a place called <ExternalLink='https://goo.gl/maps/oY3b7U9UVJZ1oYjF8'>Great Round Meadow</ExternalLink>. It's not that great, but it's flat, the path is fairly wide, and it's more or less round so you can use it for sprints just as long as you're willing to push the occasional pensioner out the way. That was the only place I came across suitable for faster running.
