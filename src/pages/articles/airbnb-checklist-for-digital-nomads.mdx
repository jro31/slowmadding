Many digital nomads spend the majority of their days living in Airbnbs. They're often non-refundable, so choosing the right one is imperetive to ensuring you live a happy and fulfilling digital nomad life.

To give myself the best chance of making sure I land a place that allows me maintain all the parts of my lifestyle that are important to me, I have a checklist of things to consider when choosing an Airbnb.

Through a room's description, photos, and reviews by previous guests, you can almost tell whether or not a unit has the things that are important to you. Don't be afraid to message the host and ask questions for anything you're uncertain about; a good host will be happy to answer.

And while many of the items on my checklist may seem obvious, when scrolling through rooms some can be quite easy to overlook, especially if you're staying in an unfamiliar part of the world.

For example, in Europe it's almost unheard of for a room to come without windows, but as I write this I'm in Taiwan and here it's pretty common. People here are very good at illuminating rooms and photographing them in a way that it appears as if they have natural light, so it's only when you stop and search the photos specifically for windows that you realise.

As having natural light is so important to me, having a checklist of things to consider before I commit to an Airbnb has saved me some unpleasant stays on more than one occasion.

I will give my checklist below. This is obviously specific to me, and you should customise your checklist based on what is important to you, and what items you carry.

After that I'll give a bit more detail about why I include each item for any that aren't self-explanatory. Then, after a bit of trial and error you can fine-tune your own list and never again regret your chosen Airbnb.

## Airbnb checklist

- Does the room receive sufficient natural light?
  - Paricularly over the bed?
- Does the unit include a kitchen?
  - A cooker?
  - Sufficient pots and pans?
- Is there an electric kettle?
- Is there a fridge?
- Is there vegan food available nearby?
- Is there a supermarket nearby?
- Is there space to exercise in the room?
- Is there somewhere to run nearby?
  - Somewhere for longer/slower runs
  - Somewhere to do intervals and sprints
- Is there a washing machine in the unit?
  - If not, is there one in the building?
  - Is there a launderette nearby?
- Is the room on the ground floor?
  - And if so, is it sufficiently secure and private?
- Does the room have heating and/or air conditioning?
- Does the Airbnb provide towels?
- How fast is the wifi?
- How noisy is the room?
- Does the bed look comfortable?

### Does the unit include a kitchen?

I don't eat any animal produce, and I follow this very strictly. Unless I'm certain that a food is vegan, I won't buy it. Particularly in countries where I don't speak the language and where English is scant, this can make eating-out challenging, so having my own kitchen to cook features very highly on my list.

I actually carry a lot of items with me. In my suitcase I have a chopping board, a knife, cutlery, a bowl, a cup, a tea towel and even a blender. This on its own is sufficient for making simple meals, like I can cut up fruit to make a fruit salad, or I can have granola with soy milk, or I can make sandwiches etc.

These are items I carry having accepted that you can never know exactly what an Airbnb will provide, and having been let down by various hosts for all them at one point or another. I wouldn't expect them to provide a blender, but everything else I'd think would be pretty standard, but fun fact, no.

These are enough for simple cold meals, but it's nice to be able to cook, so it's always worth checking the description and the photos to see what kitchen facilities an Airbnb provides, and if it's going to be sufficient to keep you happy through your stay.

### Is there an electric kettle?

I drink a lot of tea. A lot. To the point that I've even thought about carrying a kettle in my suitcase. Collapsible silicone kettles do now exist.

Yet until I do, I need to have a kettle in my room. Heating up water on the stove is a time-consuming alternative, but I'll typically eliminate from consideration any room that doesn't provide a kettle.
