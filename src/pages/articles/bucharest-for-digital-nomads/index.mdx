## Where to get vegan food in Bucharest

Getting vegan food in Bucharest is so easy that I considered removing this section. While there are only four fully-vegan restaurants in Bucharest, the attitude here has become like that of the UK, where pretty much every restaurant has _something_ vegan on the menu, so you're really not going to struggle to find food here.

Still, some places are better than others. Below were my regular spots to find vegan food.

### Level Up

Level Up is one of the four fully-vegan restaurants in Bucharest, and it was my favourite place to get food while I was here.

It serves vegan takes of a mix of foreign and local foods, with several burgers and pizzas dominating the menu. It's definitely not a place to come to be healthy, but that's just extra motivation to go for a run tomorrow.

From the outside it looks tiny, but that's because most of the seating is downstairs in a really comforatable room that has at least six sofas. That's my kind of restaurant. The staff were always really friendly, they speak English, and there's an English copy of the menu. If you only have time to eat out at one restaurant in Bucharest, make it this one.

### Sublimmme

Sublimme is another of Bucharest's fully-vegan restaurants, but apart from selling a load of cakes, is much more health-focussed than Level Up.

On weekdays they have a menu of the day, which for 42 lei consists of a soup and a main dish. I recommend that because it means you'll be served more quickly. The amount of time that other dishes take seems to vary a bit more, and it could occasionally feel like they were a little overwhelmed, despite the restaurant being quiet. I'm not if that's because they had loads of take-away orders, or if they were just really unorganised.

The restaurant itself is pretty comfortable. It has three sofas (although one was often taken by a staff member's laptop), which is probably the main thing I look for in a restaurant. If the sofas are taken, the remaining plastic chairs are far less appealing, but thankfully I never had to put myself through that. Definitely another one to visit if you have the time in Bucharest.

### Supermarkets

Having got used to being in parts of the world where the supermarkets just don't cater to vegans, going shopping in Bucharest is easy. Almost too easy. I didn't realise until I came here that I like the challenge of having to source food.

Due to its proximity to my room, I did most of my shopping at <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/e6bqcvrrVywAj3YK6'>Carrefour</ExternalLink>. This is a two-floor supermarket. On the left as you go to the second floor is a large area of 'free from' type foods. Not all vegan, some of it is gluten free or keto or whatever, but plenty of vegan things too, like vegan milks, vegan protein bars etc.

On the ground floor, which is more for fresh produce, they have one refrigerator for vegan dairy-alternatives; vegan cheeses, spreads, yogurts. A couple of aisles down they have another refrigerator of vegan meat alternatives. There is less here than you'd expect in a modern UK supermarket, but you can get vegan sausages, burgers, nuggets etc., as well as hummus, falafel. Another aisle down from here is a freezer that includes a small amount of frozen vegan foods, like vegan pizza.

This is on top of the usual things that you'll find in any supermarket around the world, like rices, pastas etc. From the ingredients I could find in Carrefour, I made things like hummus pasta, tofu stir-fry with black rice and falafel wraps.

If you can't find what you need in Carrefour, thanks to Happy Cow I found that the Mega Image on General Gheorghe Magheru street was even better-suited for vegans, and was an entire supermarket focussed-on free-from type foods. Sadly it was a bit of way from my room so I didn't come here often, but it was the best place I came across in Bucharest to buy vegan ingredients to cook with. Worth a visit if you can't find what you need in Carrefour.

## How money works in Bucharest

I found money a little ridiculous in Bucharest, so I thought this section worth adding. What I'd read prior to coming here was that while cards are accepted in some places, cash is still king and you need to carry it with you. I found this to be almost entirely false. Through my entire month in Bucharest, I only had to make one transaction by cash, because card was accepted everywhere else I went. That transaction was ironically the most expensive thing I bought, which was my one-month gym membership.

The part that I find ridiculous, is that while cards are accepted almost everywhere, in places where tipping is expected, you cannot tip via the card machine. There is no such option, so you have to carry an appropriate amount of cash with you if you have any intention of leaving a tip, only adding fuel to my fire to eradicate tipping from the world because it's stupid.

I didn't realise this at the start. I just thought that because it wasn't possible to tip via card that tipping wasn't expected, but then I got told otherwise. That was the point that I mostly stopped eating out, because as I wasn't making any cash transactions, I never had any change for tipping, so going to a restaurant suddenly had extra steps.

Whether you choose to heed this advice, or whether you choose to feign ignorance as a good excuse to not leave any tips is up to you (I'd suggest the latter), but it is worth noting that tipping is expected, but you can't leave a tip when paying by card because that would make sense.

## Where to run in Bucharest

When I chose my Airbnb in Bucharest, I did so partially because Izvor Park was so nearby, and from what I could tell on Google Maps, it'd be a good place to run. It was, so I didn't feel the need to run anywhere else in Bucharest. Even so I'd say that Bucahrest is a very running-friendly city.

The pavements are wide and quiet, as are the roads, so crossing the road is usually quick and there's very little pollution coming from vehicles. If you don't happen to be staying near a park, I'd say that you can pretty much run anywhere. If you happen to be near Tineretului Park, it's pretty big and has many people running in it.

As for Izvor Park, it's a lot smaller. A loop of the park is 1.25km (so four laps to do a 5k). Like everywhere in Bucharest, people smoke without consideration so expect to have to hold your breath while running through the plumes being exhaled. Other than that, the only downside to Izvor Park was that if you came at the wrong time (as I did a couple of times), there would be packs of poorly attended children. My guess is that a nearby school/nursery took the kids there when they couldn't be arsed to entertain them anymore and just let them run wild. When you're gasping for air having to navigate this melee could be a tad frustrating, but for most of my runs here they were nowhere to be seen.
