- Cambodia has been bought by China

## Where I stayed

### M Residence (room #707)

<AccommodationTable details={mResidenceDetails} />

You know how sometimes you find yourself staying somewhere, where the host has thought of every little thing, and does absolutely everything that they can to make you comfortable?

This isn't one of those places.

I had some initial trouble checking-in because the instructions on Airbnb were wrong, then on my first full day I got evicted for 7 hours with zero notice when some workmen came to do some redecorating.

When I was able to go back into the room, I found myself cleaning what hadn't been cleaned from the guest before.

The room itself was actually pretty spotless, probably because they had a cleaner come in once the workmen were finished, but taking one smell of the tea towels, they obviously hadn't been washed. Nor had the floor mats, so I ran all towel-type things through the washing machine.

And it does have a washing machine.

It doesn't have anywhere to dry your clothes, but you can at least wash them. My solution was to just hang them up in the cupboard and leave the doors open, but there was only enough space in there to do about half a load at a time.

It felt like the host could tick the box on Airbnb that they have a washing machine, and so they stopped there. You kind of assume that having somewhere to dry your clothes is part of that package, but apparently not. Or that in claiming to have a kitchen with pots, pans and plates, that a knife and chopping board are included. They aren't, which severly limits your ability to cook.

I carry a camping knife in my suitcase, which is a viable substitute for a kitchen knife, but without a chopping board, I resorted to using plates. And they aren't big or flat plates. They're those small ones, curved at the sides like they're trying to be bowls. Try cutting up a watermelon on one of those with a camping knife and you'll begin to understand my frustration.

Prior to staying here I'd used Airbnb very sparingly, and never for a stay of longer than a few days, so I hadn't yet learned the right questions to ask before agreeing to a longer-term let. Like how often will the room be cleaned?

Answer: Never.

I never want to be too important to clean up after myself, but I do draw the line at having to buy all the clearning products and equipment myself, when I'm only going to be there for a month. And with no cleaner either, the room just got slowly grimier throughout my stay.

That's not to say it's a bad place. It's not. The main reason that I chose to stay here over everywhere else I looked at was the location. And the location is perfect.

There are great restaurants nearby, you're only a five-minute walk from Statue of Sihanouk Norodom Park (I'm not sure that's it's actual name) which is one of the only viable places in the city to go running, there are several supermarkets within an easy walk, and there's even a sports bar right across the street.

Literally right across the street. Good luck sleeping when the World Cup final's on, but it's also not a bad place to get a beer and watch some football. They have a load of screens, so if you want to watch Everton lose in the last minute to Wolves with the commentary of the simultaneous Newcastle vs Leicester game blasting over the loud speakers, then this is the place for you.

When I lived in Bangkok, I used to rent a condo where the size was written into the contract as (just under) 29m&#178;. I've always assumed therefore, that measurement was accurate. It was quite a compact place, but it had one bedroom, a good kitchen, and a dining area within the living room.

So when I stay somewhere that describes itself as 35m&#178;, but it's a studio without any dining area and almost no free space, I'm slightly dubious. It felt significantly smaller than my Bangkok condo, to the point that I had to rearrange the furniture just to have the space to do yoga.

I'd push the coffee table into the kitchen area, and I'd *still* find myself cramped between the fridge and the bathroom.

The room itself is on the 7th floor of this almost 40-storey building, with what seems to be mainly Chinese residents, although there are other westerners.

On the top floor there is a stunningly impractical swimming pool. You come up in the middle of it, so you're surrounded 360&#176; by the pool, which stretches to the edge of the rooftop. That means that it's not really the right shape to do any serious swimming, and there isn't much space to sit by the pool either.

Of more practical value, the floor below has a pretty nice gym. It's slightly ill-equipped, with only one weights bench, despite there being the space for three or four.

As it's seldom used by other guests, I never found myself waiting for the bench, although there were multiple times that other people were waiting for me, which sucked for them because I had loads of sets to do.

The most egregious thing that happened during my stay, is that the owner, via the front-desk staff, takes a $30 key depost when you check-in. That is to be returned to you when you return the key on checkout.

I made it abundantly clear to the owner that I was checking-out early in the morning (about 6:30am), and he assured me that he had arranged it so that my deposit would be returned to me by the front-desk staff.

Of course, 6:30am comes on the day I'm checking-out, and the guy on reception has no clue about any deposit, and recommends that I keep the key instead.

I did that, and after a lot of back and forth, I eventually came to an agreement with the landlord that he'd refund me $30 through Airbnb, and then I'd return the key to him when next in Phnom Penh.

This is the very short version of that story, and I'd pay significantly more than $30 to not have to go through the stress and hassle endured to get back that deposit.

Most likely because of the bad blood from that situation, the owner later accused me of causing a huge stain on the couch. I refuted these claims, as that stain was there when I arrived (I have photos that prove this). His lack of acknowledgement of this left an even more bitter taste in the mouth than I had already.

So all in all... you could do worse. The furnishings in the room are nice, the TV is really good, the shower is hot and powerful, the AC works efficiently, the landlord is a buffoon, and I'll stress again how great the location is. It just doesn't feel homely. It feels like someone wants to do the bare minimum in order to make as much money off Airbnb as they can.

I wouldn't stay here again.

## Where to get vegan food in Phnom Penh

At the time of writing, Happy Cow listed neighbouring Thailand as having 411 vegan restaurants, neighbouring Vietnam as having 472 vegan restaurants, but Cambodia as having just nine, only four of which are in Phnom Penh.

You could take that to mean that Phnom Penh isn't a very vegan-friendly city, but once you explore a bit, you'll realise that you aren't short of places to eat.

Happy Cow is a great starting resource, but I also had a lot of success with food delivery apps in Phnom Penh. I ordered vegan food from foodpanda from multiple restaurants that weren't on Happy Cow, and with the endless barrage of special offers, getting delivery can be significantly cheaper than eating in person.

All that being said, I still prefer to eat in a restaurant. These are my favourite places from my time in Phnom Penh:
