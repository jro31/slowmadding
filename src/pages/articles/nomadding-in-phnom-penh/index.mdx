## Where I stayed

### M Residence (room #707)

<AccommodationTable details={mResidenceDetails} />

After a little trouble due to some unclear instructions, when I finally checked-into my Airbnb, I immediately noticed that there were some significant patches of paint peeling off the wall.

This wasn't present in any of the photos in the listing, but even so I decided I'd rather live it for a month, than have to deal with any workmen coming into the room to fix it.

That same evening, I got a message from the host saying that his cleaner had informed him of this damage, and would I like to have it fixed. I responded saying that it was fine to leave until I've checked-out, and he responded that's what he'd do.

The next morning, I got a knock at the door at 10am, and standing there are three workmen with all their equipment, wanting to come in to paint the walls. So with zero notice, I got essentially evicted from the room.

Thankfully I'd already had a shower and was slowly making plans for the day at this point. My suitcase was already locked closed and padlocked to an immovable object by this point (as it always is when I go out), so it didn't take much for me to throw some things into my rucksack and leave them to it, with them telling me it'd take about two hours.

I wandered for a little while, then got an early lunch, coming back to the room after about two and a half hours.

The workmen were nowhere to be seen, but their equipment was still in the room and the furniture was still moved away from the walls in a manner that made the room unusable. I figured they'd be coming back in a bit, so I went out right away and went to the supermarket.

When I came back, this time about four hours after they'd initially arrived in the room, it was the same story. So I put away my shopping, and went out for a third time.

I came back after a couple more hours. Up to this point, despite the frustration and inconvenience of not being able to use the room all day, having only arrived in the country the evening before, I still managed to keep a smile on my face. But on coming back again to find that they still hadn't finished was the point that I felt myself starting to get frustrated.

As I eventually found out, they didn't have access to the room. So they'd been waiting for me to come back so that I could let them in, so that I could finish working.

As the cleaners have access to all of the rooms, I'd assumed that the maintenance people did too, but as it turns-out... no.

So I waited at the room, let them in so that they could finish, and then went out yet again.

I came back an hour later, now seven hours since first getting evicted from the room, kind of at the end of my tether. If I was still unable to use the room, I'd have definitely left my place of happiness. But then I started considering all the mess they might leave in the room, because workmen aren't known for how well they clean up after themselves.

Thankfully, they appear to have got one of the cleaners to come in afterwards. They can't have long been gone, because the floor was still freshly mopped, but finally I had a clean and clear room that I could relax in.

It wasn't a very good start.

I'd used Airbnb sporadically and for short-term stays in the past. This was my first time using it for anything longer than a few days, and as a result of that, I was yet to learn the right questions to ask a host before making a booking. In this case, how often will the room be cleaned during my stay?

Answer: None.

That wouldn't bother me if there were clearning products and equipment to use. I never want to become too important to clean up after myself, but I really didn't want to pay for and transport all the products and equipment I'd need to clean it myself, so instead I just accepted that for the duration of my stay, the room would slowly get grimier.

And if I'm honest, it hadn't been spotless when I'd moved-in. Just smelling the tea towels, for example, told me they definitely hadn't been washed from the previous tenants. So one of the first things I did was wash all the towels and floor mats, because no one else had.

I also found a lot of junk left my previous tenants dotted all over the room, so had a cupboard dedicated to crap left by other people.

It became completely full.

After that horrendous start, all of which was in the first 48 hours after getting here, it actually became quite a pleasant place to stay.

It's a building of almost 40 floors, the top couple of which include a gym and a swimming pool.

The pool flatters to decieve a little. It's on the rooftop and looks amazing, because you come up some stairs in the middle of it, so the water is on all sides of you, with 360(degree) views.

I went up there on my first day, took some photos and... never went up there again.

The gym has much more practical value, and I found myself working-out quite a lot during my stay. Sadly it's a little under-equipped. The three treadmills, elliptical and the rowing machine mean that it's great if you want to do some cardio. However, despite the mass of available space, they only have one weights bench. My good fortune meant that this bench was always available whenever I wanted it, but I would often see people eyeing it while I was working-out, looking at me with frustration as they pretended to do something else while they waited.

The flat itself is only on the 7th floor; the lowest residential floor in the building, so don't get any ideas of it having an amazing view. It doesn't. The space around the balcony is crowded-out by other nearby skyscapers.

There's a sports bar on the road directly below. This wasn't a problem 90% of the time (and it's actually a decent bar to go and watch football). There were a small number of nights however, such as the World Cup final, where the noise and cheering from this sports bar did make sleep somewhat difficult to come by.

Do you know how some Airbnb hosts have a passion for making sure their guests are happy and are going to have a really pleasant stay?

This isn't one of those places. Although there's nothing wrong with this room, it doesn't feel like it's been given any thought to what it's actually like to live in. It feels like it's been equipped with the bare minimum that it needs, in order to be able to list certain perks, like a kitchen, on Airbnb.

For example, you have this decent kitchen with a saucepan and a frying pan. But do you know what you dont have?

A knife or a chopping board. Which severely limits your ability to cook anything worthwhile.

I carry a camping knife with my in my suitcase, which isn't ideal for cutting fruits and vegetables, but it works if there's nothing else. And for a chopping board I just had to use the plates, which were very small, bowl-shaped plates. Those ones that go up at the sides.

You try cutting up a watermelon with a camping knife on one of those.

And there's a washing machine on the balcony, which is great.

Nowhere to dry your clothes though. A clothes horse would have been a nice touch.

I ended up just hanging them up in the cupboard and leaving the cupboard doors open, because there was nowhere else.

As the landlord didn't visit the room prior to my arrival to see for himself the damage to the paint, I can safely assume that he doesn't come here often. Couple that with the lack of practicality of so much of the included equipment, and it does feel like it's here more to make him money that to provide guests with a comfortable stay.

It's listed on Airbnb as a 35m(squared) room, but I used to live in a 28m(squared) room, and it had a lot more space than this one. Here I had to rearrange the furniture by moving the coffee table into the kitchen area, just so I had enough space to do some very cramped yoga.

It may sound from what I've written so far that I didn't enjoy my stay here, but that's not entirely true. Apart from anything else, the location (the main reason I chose to stay here) is excellent. Lots of good food nearby, supermarkets easy walking distance, and a <Link href='#where-to-run-in-phnom-penh'>nearby place to run</Link>. And for all its flaws, this room was perfectly comfortable.

The AC worked very well, the shower was really warm and powerful and the bed was comfortable. So it checks all the boxes of what you might consider essential. It just doesn't feel very homely.

## Where to get vegan food in Phnom Penh

Happy Cow is the most comprehensive database for the availability of vegan food that I've ever come across.

At the time of writing, it listed neighbouring Thailand as having 411 vegan restaurants. It listed neighbouring Vietnam as having 472 vegan restaurants. And yet <ExternalLink url="https://www.happycow.net/asia/?filters=vegan">it listed Cambodia as having just 9</ExternalLink>, only four of which are in Phnom Penh.

You could mistake this to mean that Phnom Penh isn't a very vegan-friendly city, and at first glance it certainly feels like it. But once you've explored a bit, you'll realise that you aren't short of places to eat.

<ExternalLink url="https://www.happycow.net/">Happy Cow</ExternalLink> is a great starting resource, but I also had a lot of success with food delivery apps in Phnom Penh.

Grab was ok (better for getting Tuktuks than food tbh), but I found that <ExternalLink url="https://www.foodpanda.com.kh/en/">foodpanda</ExternalLink> multiple restaurants with vegan options that weren't on Happy Cow.

I've never really been one for food delivery. I either like to cook myself, or go out and find food. But even for me, I found myself getting several meals delivered, because the constant barrage of special offers meant that I could get restaurant food delievered to my door, several dollars cheaper than it would have cost me to eat in the restaurant. And it's fast.

I had one meal of Indian food come from 2km away, get delivered just 17 minutes after pressing 'Order' on the app.

As the delivery riders are all clad in the colours the service that they work for, I noticed several other local delivery apps that you could also try. Off the top of my head, I can think of <ExternalLink url="https://www.wownow-kh.com/">WowNow</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink url="https://nham24.com/">nham24</ExternalLink>. I didn't use either of these, so I can't vouch for them. But if you do find yourself getting hungry in Phnom Penh, then they are another couple of options to try.

All that being said, I still prefer to eat in a restaurant. I tried three of Phnom Penh's four fully-vegan restaurants, and rate all of them incredibly well. However, don't discount Phnom Penh's vegetarian and meat-serving restaurants that have vegan options. I ate some incredibly high-quality vegan food in several of them as well.

These are my favourite places to eat from my time in Phnom Penh:
