## Why did I come to Maha Sarakham?

## Getting to Maha Sarakham

I came to Maha Sarakham from Khon Kaen. I can speak and read Thai, and even so I didn't find it entirely straight forward either at the Khon Kaen end or at the Maha Sarakham end.

In Khon Kaen, you're looking for a bus company called 'Pink Bus'. None of their signs are in English, and in the Khon Kaen bus station 3, they're located in terminal 3, which is away from other bus companies and past the minivans and a couple of restaurants, which is why I didn't find it easy to locate. I had to ask at two different information counters, the first of which didn't know where they were.

You'll find their ticket office <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/JHZFD6ksVawp4g1b8'>here</ExternalLink>, but beware there's no English signage and the staff to speak English. There are roughly five buses per day that travel to Maha Sarakham, but the times of these seemingly vary, as the times I was given by my hotel differed from the actual times, and they only had the departure times for the day scribbled down on a piece of paper behind the counter - they weren't actually published anywhere.

I'd been aiming for a 10am bus, and luckily the next one was only at 10:30am, so I didn't have a huge wait, but worth calling them first if you have the means of doing so. A ticket to Maha Sarakham cost 70 baht.

The reviews on that Google Maps link describe the staff as being very rude. They aren't overly talkative, but I found them to be fine. They might be less patient if you try speaking to them in English.

The bus trip was perfectly comfortable for a 70 baht ticket. It took a little under two hours to get to Maha Sarakham, but worth noting that Maha Sarakham wasn't the final destination, and the bus didn't actually pull into the bus terminal, as I was expecting it to. Nor was there any announcement from the conductor or driver that we were in Maha Sarakham. Instead the bus pulled-up outside <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/2JB3MM3sKwezw8qF8'>this 7-11</ExternalLink>, about 100m away from the bus terminal. And as people started getting off, I got off too.

Had I not been paranoidly following along on Google Maps, instead just waiting to pull into a bus terminal, I could have easily missed this, so make sure you're paying attention. Even though your tickets gives your destination as Maha Sarakham bus terminal, the bus might not actually make it there.
