## Where to get vegan food in Loei

As usual, my primary resource for finding vegan food was Happy Cow. I'd looked prior to coming here and knew that Loei only featured two restaurants on Happy Cow; both the standard local 'jay' restaurants.

'Jay' ('เจ' in Thai) basically means vegan, but it also prohibits certain vegetables, such as garlic and onions. For years I thought the reason for this was that in buddhism you aren't supposed to kill living things, so you can eat fruits and vegetables that don't require you to kill the entire plant (like tomatoes), but you can't eat anything where if you eat it, the plant dies, like garlic. I read recently that it's actually because foods like garlic and onion have such a strong taste that they cause imbalance to your emotions, and in buddhism you're supposed to be fucking... zen or whatever. Either way, 'jay' food is fully vegan, so I knew that I'd be able to find vegan food in at least a couple of places in Loei.

Beyond Happy Cow, usually you can find more vegan food by wandering the streets and looking out for 'jay' signs at street vendors, or by looking on delivery apps like FoodPanda and Grab and searching for vegan food on there.

I found nothing else.

These two restaurants, which I'll detail below, were great, but as is typical for such restaurants, they're family-run lunch restaurants. They close before the evening and as I found, both are closed on Sundays.

I was unable to find anywhere else in Loei to get a hot plate of food, so for sustenance at other times I had to pretty much snack on whatever I could find.

On my first day here I went to Big C and bought a week's worth of granola and soy milk. That meant that I could at least have a bowl of granola everyday. There are vendors dotted around Loei selling pre-cut fruit; I visited them a lot, and was fortunate to have a vendor who set-up a couple of minutes walk from my room selling mango sticky rice.

7-11 has a couple of vegan frozen meals, which never leave you feeling too great but are good in a pinch. If you have a microwave in your room, and a freezer or at least an ice compartment in a fridge, then you can get a few of these for when you need. Otherwise you can have them heated in 7-11.

Other than that I got by, snacking on various vegan foods from 7-11 and Lotus. In lotus they have tinned fruit, such as rambutan stuffed with pineapple. In 7-11 they sell pre-made juices and smoothies, and nuts and crisps.

I'm fairly certain I lost a bit of weight while I was here, because despite the snacking, I was only eating one hot meal per day, and not even on Sunday, but once I'd explored the town and knew what was available it was ok.
