## Where to get vegan food in Loei

As usual, my primary resource for finding vegan food was Happy Cow. I'd looked prior to coming here and knew that Loei only featured two restaurants on Happy Cow; both the standard local 'jay' restaurants.

'Jay' ('เจ' in Thai) basically means vegan, but it also prohibits certain vegetables, such as garlic and onions. For years I thought the reason for this was that in buddhism you aren't supposed to kill living things, so you can eat fruits and vegetables that don't require you to kill the entire plant (like tomatoes), but you can't eat anything where if you eat it, the plant dies (like garlic). I read recently that it's actually because foods like garlic and onion have such a strong taste that they cause imbalance to your emotions, and in buddhism you're supposed to be fucking... zen or whatever. Either way, 'jay' food is fully vegan, so I knew that I'd be able to find vegan food in at least a couple of places in Loei.

Beyond Happy Cow, usually you can find more vegan food by wandering the streets and looking out for 'jay' signs at street vendors, or by looking on delivery apps like FoodPanda and Grab and searching for vegan food on there.

I found nothing else.

These two restaurants, which I'll detail below, were great, but as is typical for such restaurants, they're family-run lunch restaurants. They close before the evening and as I found, both are closed on Sundays.

I was unable to find anywhere else in Loei to get a hot plate of food, so for sustenance at other times I had to pretty much snack on whatever I could find.

On my first day here I went to Big C and bought a week's worth of granola and soy milk. That meant that I could at least have a bowl of granola everyday. There are vendors dotted around Loei selling pre-cut fruit; I visited them a lot, and was fortunate to have a vendor who set-up a couple of minutes walk from my room selling mango sticky rice.

7-11 has a couple of vegan frozen meals, which never leave you feeling too great but are good in a pinch. If you have a microwave in your room, and a freezer or at least an ice compartment in a fridge, then you can get a few of these for when you need. Otherwise you can have them heated in 7-11.

Other than that I got by snacking on various vegan foods from 7-11 and Lotus. In lotus they have tinned fruit, such as rambutan stuffed with pineapple. In 7-11 they sell pre-made juices and smoothies, and nuts and crisps.

I'm fairly certain I lost a bit of weight while I was here, because despite the snacking, I was only eating one hot meal per day, and not even on Sunday, but once I'd explored the town and knew what was available it was ok.

## Where to run in Loei

Prior to coming to Loei, I'd looked at <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/7pVDXhnmrkxHfYHH8'>Kut Pong Public Park</ExternalLink> as the most viable place to go running, and it definitely is a viable place to go running. During my evening wanderings I saw people running here.

I didn't walk around the entire park, but there's a track around at least part of it. It's not huge though. A circuit of the park would maybe be 400m. A possible extension would be to include running on the other side of the water, which had a path going around it.

On my bus into Loei from Udon Thani, I noticed a separated cycle path that runs south alongside the 201 highway from roughly adjacent to the Loei Bus Terminal. I didn't see a single bicycle on there though, just the occasional stray motorcycle, despite the 'No motorcycle' signs.

As the bus was getting towards Loei town, I was salivating at this empty cycle path, as I thought it'd be perfect for running, and I stand-by that.

One warning would be that I walked down it a little bit on my way back from a supermarket one day, and I passed some slightly territorial dogs, who can react more to people running than people walking, but even so, I maintain it's a very viable option if you want to go for a longer run without doing loops.

The reason that I never ran along this cycle path, nor in Kut Pong Public Park was that they were both a bit of a distance from where I was staying, where as much closer to my room I found that the Loei Provincial Hall had a cycle track in its grounds. It was ridiculous as a cycle track as it was only a little over 400m long and had sharp corners. I'm not sure who'd ever want to cycle there, and I never saw anyone who did. However for running it was perfect.

I did two runs here, both in the daytime, so I had the track to myself. In the evenings it attracts a few more runners, but I never saw it actually become busy, so it's a really good place to go.

It's just over 400m long. To do a 5km run was 12 laps, so it does get a bit repetitive. I wouldn't have wanted to run much farther here. Luckily I'm horrendously unfit at the moment, so I was happy with 5km.

## Where to do laundry in Loei

This might be a strange section to include; it can't be that hard to do laundry can it?

Well you wouldn't have thought so. My usual strategy for finding somewhere to do laundry is to get on Google Maps, search for 'Laundrette', and go to a nearby place with positive reviews. That's what I did in Loei, but pretty much every laundrette that Google Maps returned isn't actually a laundrette.

I'd find myself at clothes shops, or at peoples houses, but I was wandering around for hours before ever finding a laundrette, and given the time of year, it was 40°C and I got a really sunburnt head. So to save you also giving yourself skin cancer, <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/pZ5Uk74WppBGnfrNA'>this is the place</ExternalLink> that I finally found that actually is a laundrette.

Of course it's only about a three-minute walk from where my room, but just in the opposite direction that i went.

It's run by a couple of older women who don't speak a word of English between them so we barely communicated with my very broken Thai, but I was able to understand that I should come back the next afternoon.

When I did, my clothes were clean and folded, and what will have been roughly 3kg of laundry cost 150 baht.

## Being sociable in Loei

There's nothing. Literally nothing.

I searched for any Meetup events. Nothing. I searched for any Facebook events. Nothing. So on a Saturday evening I decided I'd just go to the one bar described as being a 'western' bar in Loei: Saloon Loei.

It was closed.

I wandered down the rest of Ruam Pattana, which I'd read was the closest thing to a bar street that Loei has. Almost everything else was closed as well, so I gave up and went home. That's the spirit.

If you know people locally I'm sure your experience would be different, but being in Loei alone and as a foreigner, I found nowhere that I wanted to go and have a drink.

Which is probably good, because my liver needed a break.
