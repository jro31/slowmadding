If you spend any amount of time on digital nomad forums, you'll notice the same cities come up over and over again. Medellin, Mexico City and Lisbon are three of the most prominent, but Chiang Mai features just as often, and for the life of me, I can't figure-out why.

When I lived in Bangkok, I used to come here a lot. I would describe it as a break from Thailand, because you come here and everything is in English and everything is geared towards tourists. I lived in a local area in Bangkok where that wasn't really the case, so when I wanted a break from the big city, and for everything to just be easy for a few days, I'd come to Chiang Mai.

I don't know if it was the changes that were forced upon Chiang Mai because the pandemic, or the fact that I had changed and had different needs when coming back here as a digital nomad, but I just didn't really enjoy it.

I noticed that a lot of businesses had closed since my prior visit in 2018; restaurants that I used to like going to, for example. But when a city so reliant on tourism goes through a pandemic, that is unsurprising.

When I came back this time, in 2022, I would guess that tourist numbers were at about 25% of the pre-pandemic levels. Many of the businesses that had survived were looking a little sorry. For example, there's this little area of bars/clubs, that I could hear from the pumping music 100 metres away.

I was just exploring at that time, so I figured I'd check it out, maybe grab a drink. But yet I got here, and all these bars; at least a dozen of them, with lights flashing and DJs, barely had a customer between them.

Chiang Mai felt like an old woman trying to recapture her lost beauty.

I'll add the caveat to this diatribe that I generally avoid motorcycles. From a 2011 visit to Northern Thailand, I have the scars to prove that they aren't altogether safe. And now somewhat older and wiser, having heard stories of people who got into biking accidents in Thailand so severe that their parents back home had to remortgage their house just to pay the medical bills. Licences don't matter much in Thailand. Whether you've got a licence or not, you can rent a motorcycle. However, being on one without a licence would invalidate my travel insurance were I to have an accident, so I don't take the chance.

The reason that matters, is that's just how people get around in Chiang Mai, and if you don't have a motorcycle you are somewhat limited in being able to get out of the city.

Chiang Mai itself is a fairly unattractive, but the mountains surrounding it are gorgeous if you can get readily to them. So a person willing to ride a motorcycle is going to have a very different experience to that which I'm describing.

As it is, I walked everywhere when I was here, and I found the pollution levels to be somewhat smothering. There are fewer vehicles here than in Bangkok, but for some reason the pollution here just sits. Someone suggested to me that it's because the surrounding mountains make it like a bowl, but after a day of walking, you feel it in your throat.

That could be remedied with a nice, open green space within the city. Unfortunately there isn't one. There are a couple of parks, so small that you cannot escape the noise of the nearby main roads, but you have to go all the way up to the university to find anything that resembles being in nature.

Hopefully this is a temporary blip, and in a couple of years once it's had the time to properly recover from the pandemic, I can rewrite this article with the glowing sentiment that I once held for Chiang Mai. For now I would suggest avoiding it, as it feels a shadow of its pre-pandemic self.

## Where to get vegan food in Chiang Mai

This is where Chiang Mai really shines. It has the highest concentration and variety of quality vegan restaurants that I've come across anywhere in the world. For all its other flaws, you will enjoy eating here.

### Reform Kafe

Right at the top of my list is Reform Kafe. This is my favourite restaurant in Chiang Mai.

It's part of the Green Tiger House hotel, which itself is a vegan hotel. I don't know what that means, but I do know it commits to being eco-friendly and sustainable. Had it been within my price range, I'd have loved to stay here.

Reform Kafe takes up a large space on the ground floor. It's open air, and reminds me somewhat of a Japanese Garden. There's a large water feature that gives you the therapeutic sound of dripping water in the background. Given the rest of the layout, which includes a large tree in the middle of the garden, and a pretty chilled cat, I would always leave here feeling so relaxed, no matter how I felt when I arrived.

It offers a similar menu to its sister restaurant, <ExternalLink>Goodsouls</ExternalLink>, which is highly recommended in itself. However, I preferred Reform Kafe. Goodsouls is inside and air conditioned, and could occasionally be a little frantic, where as Reform Kafe is outdoors, natural and relaxed. And the food is amazing.

The menu has plenty of variety, from sandwiches and pancakes, to smoothie bowls and burgers, so you can always find what you're in the mood for, and the food here is always excellent. It really is the complete package.

A relaxing place to come and sit, very friendly and efficient staff, it's reasonably priced, and the food is various, large and delicious.
