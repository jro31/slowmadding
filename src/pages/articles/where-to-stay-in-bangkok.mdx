Bangkok is the city that has everything. No matter what you're looking for, Bangkok has it. Whether you're able to find it or not is another matter. This article details how to decide which area to stay in Bangkok.

## Where is the centre of Bangkok?

Bangkok centres around Sukhumvit. Other people will dispute that, claiming that Siam or even Silom are the centre of Bangkok, and that's ok. They're allowed to be wrong. When coming to Bangkok for the first time and trying to figure-out where to stay, start with Sukhumvit (around the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Yd49e6y2G7haRh988'>Terminal 21 shopping mall</ExternalLink>) and work outwards from there until you find what you're looking for.

## Nana, Siam and ...

If you head north-west just a few hundred metres, you'll get to Nana, which is the horribly touristy area favoured by sexpats and the many bars catering to them. If you're coming to Bangkok for daytime drinking and prostitutes, you need look no further. If you're here for anything else, I recommend not staying in this Nana.

Continue north-west another kilometre and you'll make it to Siam. If you love shopping, and particularly shopping malls, then this is your dream. Siam Paragon and Central World are two of best known hi-so shopping malls in the area, and MBK is great for a faux Thai experience.

Unfortunately, if you want to stay in Siam it won't come cheap, and as someone who doesn't care much for shopping malls, I don't recommend this area. There isn't too much going on beyond the shopping malls.

## Phrom Pong, Thong Lo, Ekkamai and On Nut

If instead you go south-east from Sukhumvit, the further you travel the more you'll be in areas favoured by expats over tourists. Firstly you'll be in Phrom Pong. I recommend this area, particularly to someone coming to Bangkok for the first time. You're away from the extreme tourism, but you're still in an area that a lot of tourists choose to stay in so everything is very easy and there'll be things that, as a digital nomad, will be useful.

Beyond Phrom Pong you get to Thong Lo, and then to Ekkamai. Both areas are heavily favoured by expats so are great if you want to meet foreigners living rather than visitng Bangkok. Travelling on from there things will get more local and less expensive. On Nut is a place where many expats who want to live a bit more cheaply choose to stay.

## Silom and Sathorn

Going south-west from Suhumvit you're going to reach the Sathorn/Silom area. Silom was once a bustling area of the city, but coming back since the pandemic it's died a bit. I love Sathorn and lived there for more than three years. You're still near enough to the central parts of the city, but can also find some peace. It's not a cheap area to stay if you're a digital nomad on a budget though.

## Rama 9, Ladprao and Ari

Heading north from Sukhumit, you'll get to areas of the city that are visited much less by tourists, but that still feel like the city centre. Rama 9 has some more shopping malls but there isn't too much more there. I lived in Ladprao for a couple of years, and it feels like its own city, having its own downtown area around Phahon Yothin, and for years I wanted to live in the area between Saphan Kwai and Ari. I always thought it was the perfect area, bustling with life but only a short walk from Chattuchak Park, away from all the tourists but within easy reach of some fun bars around Victory Monument or in Ladprao.

Unfortunately it's so void of tourists that I've never been able to find anywhere that I actually want to stay there as a digital nomad. If I ever live in Bangkok again though, it'll definitely be on my list.

## TODO

If you like staying in big cities, then Bangkok has exactly what you're looking for. The trouble is finding it, especially if you've never been here before. I'd recommend avoiding the Khao San Road and Nana areas as they're both unpleasantly touristy. They can be easily visited for a night out, but I wouldn't want to stay in them. Other than that, many areas of the city have positives. If you've never been here before and you're completely unsure, then around Phrom Pong/Thong Lo is a safe option. Neither are the most exciting, but you'll have everything you need nearby and almost everyone you encounter will speak English.
