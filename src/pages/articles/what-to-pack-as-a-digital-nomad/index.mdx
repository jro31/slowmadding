A list of every item that I own.

## My bags

I carry two bags with me:

A fake Swissgear rucksack, and a 63.5cm x 44.4cm x 29.2cm suitcase. Everything comfortably fits in these two bags with the suitcase weighing around 15kg.

## Fitness

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08LPYZV98'>Folding yoga mat</ExternalLink>, two <ExternalLink url='https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cork-yoga-brick/_/R-p-323475'>yoga blocks</ExternalLink> and a <ExternalLink url='https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cotton-yoga-strap/_/R-p-183211'>yoga strap</ExternalLink>

It might seem mad that roughly a third of my suitcase is taken up by a yoga mat and yoga blocks, and perhaps it is, but I would have a hard time justifying being digital nomad if I knew it was negatively impacting my long-term health compared to being settled.

So much of my lifestyle is driven by a fear of one day being old and immobile, and perhaps the biggest of those fears is losing my flexibility. To stave-off that inevitability I do yoga whenever I can, and I just wouldn't be able to do it as well without a mat and my yoga blocks.

My folding yoga mat packs flat into my suitcase, and even fits into my rucksack if I want to take it to a class outside of my room. I'm still waiting for someone to invent travel yoga blocks, so in the mean time I carry around these two bricks with me.

### Wrist wallet

### Phone armband

## Sustenance

Being a vegan digital nomad can greatly limit the places you can comfortably travel to, especially if you're going somewhere that getting an apartment isn't viable so you're limited to hotels, and hence have no cooking facilities. That leaves you limited to restaurants. In some places in the world veganism just isn't a thing, and in others there's no English for you to communicate what you want.

In such situations having your own equipment can be a lifesaver because you at least have the means to cut-up fruit and make a fruit salad, or to get some granola and soy milk from the supermarket.

If your diet is more liberal or you don't plan on going anywhere off the beaten path, these items won't be necessary, but from my experience you can have the confidence to go to more remote, less vegan-friendly places when you know that you can prepare limited foods on your own.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09B3L9XY5'>Personal blender</ExternalLink>

When space is limited, carrying around a blender in my suitcase might sound crazier than carrying two yoga blocks, but I use my blender a couple of times per day, no matter where in the world I am. I start and finish everyday with a fruit smoothie, and my health would be undoubtedly worse without it.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NH42V2R'>Small chopping board</ExternalLink>

I've stayed in Airbnbs that have knives, but that don't have chopping boards. Having one of your own when in ill-equipped kitchens on when staying in hotels allows you to much more easily cut-up fruit, for example.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08FMFZ2NC'>Travel cutlery</ExternalLink>

You should get cultery in any Airbnb, but its much less likely in a hotel room. You've ordered a take-away and they didn't include cutlery? For as little space as it takes up, you'll be glad you have your own.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09WH3RY76'>Flat-pack silicone bowl</ExternalLink>

Primarily favoured by dogs, silicone bowls pack flat so they don't take up much space in your suitcase, but can be popped-out into a bowl shape whenever you feel like some granola or a fruit salad.

### Camping knife and sheath

When I was much younger and dumber, I went hitch-hiking through the wilderness of Canada. I bought my camping knife, with it's three-inch blade in case I got attacked by any grizzly bears.

Thankfully that never happened, because now I know what a grizzly bear is it turns out it wouldn't have been much help and I'd be much more dead. None-the-less I found my camping knife to be an incredibly useful tool, and it's been with me everywhere I've been in the world for the fifteen years since.

Once you know how, it's easier and faster to open cans with a knife than with a can opener, you're often going to find yourself needing to cut string or dig-out splinters or take-out screws. With a big of ingenuity, your knife can do all of that. It's probably not the best-suited knife for what I now need it for, which more often than not is cutting-up fruit, but we've been together too long, me and knifey.

### Knife sharpener

Back when I was living in Park City in Utah in 2010, I wandered into the Walmart and happened to see this little knife-sharpening tool. I think it cost about a dollar.

Opening enough cans can dull your knife, so I bought this little knife sharpener, and just like my knife, it's been with me ever since. Not only is it great for keeping knifey sharp, but one of the first things I do when I check-into a new Airbnb is sharpen all the knives. It's something that even the most attentive hosts seem to neglect, and can make cooking so much easier.

## Tech

### 14" 2023 M2 MacBook Pro with charger, <ExternalLink url='https://www.tomtoc.com/products/tomtoc-versatile-a13-360-protective-laptop-sleeve-for-14-new-macbook-pro-black?variant=43597005750502'>protective case</ExternalLink> and microfibre cloth

The most important item I own, my MacBook puts the digital into digital nomad.

### iPhone 12 Mini + charger

### Apple Watch + charger

### Apple TV 4 + Siri Remote, HDMI cable and power cable

The greatest item I almost left behind. Despite being less than a quarter the size of one yoga block, when I first left as a digital nomad, I'd decided that my trusty Apple TV, which I've had since 2015, took up too much space. In a last-minute change of heart, I threw it into my bag and I'm so glad that I did.

An Apple TV plugs into any TV with an HDMI port (so basically any TV) and essentially turns it into a smart TV. Even if you are staying somewhere that has a smart TV, the UI of the Apple TV is so much more pleasing to use than trying to get Netflix setup using the TV's remote controller.

The Apple TV will remember all your login details, so the only thing you need to do it connect it to your room's wifi and you're good to go with Netflix or any other equivalent service that you use.

Even more importantly for me, there's a Peloton app for Apple TV. As I have a Peloton Digital subscription, it means I can use the TV in my room for workouts, which is a world away from having to do them on my phone screen. There are equivalent apps for other fitness services like Apple Fitness+.

There are alternative products to the Apple TV, like Chromecast and Amazon's Fire Stick. If you don't want your TV viewing to be limited to terrestrial channels in the language of the country that you're in though, having one such device is worth it.

### AirPods Pro

If you'd asked me two months ago, I'd have told you that the AirPods Pro are the most perfect product Apple's ever created. I've used mine extensively in the two and a half years I've owned them and the battery doesn't feel like it's degraded at all. They work seemlessly with my phone, my Mac and my Apple TV, so in a typical day I could use them to play some motivational songs while going for a run or to the gym, to listen to a podcast while having lunch, to play some music when I go to the supermarket, to play nature sounds while meditating, and then to listen to whatever show I'm watching on Netflix in the evening. It wouldn't be uncommon for me to use them four hours per day.

A couple of months ago though, right after arriving in Bucharest, I started having an issue when my left ear became completely blocked with earwax, and my right ear was feeling a little full too. It took me three weeks to make the connection to my AirPods, but eventually I decided that wearing them so much, I was continually pushing ear wax back into my ear every time I put them in, and stopping ear wax from falling out by wearing them. Having been basically deaf in one ear for three weeks, within three or four days of ceasing using my AirPods, my ears cleared and I've had perfect hearing ever since.

They're still a great product, but I don't use them much anymore, as I didn't really enjoy being partially deaf for almost all my time in Bucharest.

### Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad

### Nextstand

### Extension cord

I cannot stress enough the importance of having an extension cord in your suitcase. Assuming that it's an extension cord from your home country, it'll give you multiple outlets for your electronics while needing just one converter plug. I actually have an extension cord from Thailand, but that's where most of my electronics come from.

Beyond giving you the need to carry fewer converter plugs, it's amazing how often you'll find yourself staying somewhere that the plugs aren't where you need them. Want to work from the sofa but there's no plug nearby? There's an extension cord for that. Want to charge your phone on your bedside table while you sleep but there aren't any outlets next to the bed? There's an extension cord for that. Want to plug-in your Apple TV but there are only two outlets next to the TV and they're taken-up by the TV and the wifi router? There's an extension cord for that.

Just trust me on this one.

### External hard drive and Apple USB-C to USB adapter

If my laptop ever breaks or gets stolen, it would be a huge pain to have to restore it from scratch, so I do weekly backups to my external hard drive and keep the hard drive separate.

### Apple USB-C to lightning cable

Primarily so I can do backups of my iPhone to my Mac.

### 5x converter plugs

## Clothing

## Shoes

## Hygiene

### Body-hair clippers with charging cable

### Toiletries

I have a shower bag, and in it I keep travel-sized shampoo, mouthwash, shaving foam, moisturiser and sun screen.

The shampoo is just for emergencies; almost every place you stay will provide some. I get through about a litre of mouthwash every month, so buying a big bottle is one of the first things I do when I go somewhere new. I carry a travel-sized one with me just in case I'm not able to get any right away. I don't shave very often, so travel shaving foam lasts me a couple of months, and I only use moisturiser after shaving, so that will last me a couple of years. I never use the sun screen. In fact, I remember where I was when I bought this bottle, so I can tell you that it was in January 2015. More than eight years later I'm still less than halfway through it, I just carry it around because it's one of those things that you feel like you're supposed to have.

I then have a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, razor, spare razor heads, chapstick, tweezers, nail clippers, nail scissors and a eucalyptus oil inhaler.

I get the smallest toothpaste I can find when my previous tube runs out. Absolutely no point in hauling around four months worth of toothpaste with you. The only razor I've ever used where my neck doesn't look like a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the Gillette Sensitive razor, the razor heads for which are very expensive and aren't available everywhere in the world. Therefore I change the razor head as infrequently as possible, endeavouring to get at least three months out of each one, and carry up to eight spares to give me a couple of years worth of shaves. I've never used the nail scissors to cut my nails, but they are useful for things like cutting loose threads from my clothes. The eucalyptus inhaler came about when I had a cold in Thailand. Everyone seems to wander around with one there, and they're incredibly cheap and available in every convenience store. I've had mine for months and I still sniff on it occasionally when I need waking up.

## Security

### <ExternalLink url='https://pacsafe.co.uk/collections/accessories-locks/products/wrapsafe-adjustable-cable-lock'>Pacsafe Wrapsafe adjustable cable lock</ExternalLink>

I've carried a Pacsafe product with me for just about the entirety of my time backpacking and travelling. They create devices to secure your belongings. In my backpacking days I had a steel net that wrapped around my backpack, securing it closed allowing me to lock it to something or to know that no baggage handlers would be going through it when I checked it in. Nowadays I have the adjustable cable lock which allows which I can wrap around my suitcase and secure it to something. If I have even an ounce of apprehension about the security of the place that I'm staying, which is very common if I'm staying in a hotel with cleaners coming into the room, then every time I go out I put all of my valuables in my suitcase and lock it to an immovable object within the room.

### 2x padlocks

One locks onto the Pacsafe, the other locks the zip of my suitcase closed. Don't forget the keys.

### Condoms

### 2x Apple AirTags

AirTags are a tiny Apple device that you can use to track your belongings. They don't contain a GPS module theselves, rather work by crowd GPS, which means that they transmit bluetooth signals. If any GPS-enabled Apple device is in the vicinity, it submits the AirTag's location to iCloud, where you can find it in the FindMy app on your iPhone. So basically you're using other people's Apple devices to track your belongings.

I keep one in my suitcase, and one in my rucksack. The hope is that if either ever go missing I'll have an easier time locating them again if I can see their location on my phone.

I should stress that this is not an anti-theft device. In order to prevent AirTags being used for stalking people, if an iPhone notices that someone else's AirTag is travelling with it, it will send a notification to the iPhone and the AirTag will play a sound. Therefore, if someone with an iPhone steals your rucksack, they'll soon be notified that your AirTag is travelling with them and dispose of it, so it wouldn't be good for tracking then.

Rather, for accidental loss like if you leave your bag on the bus, or if an airline loses your luggage, then it could be useful.

Thankfully I haven't needed mine for such circumstances yet. The only use I've had is I can advance if my checked-in suitcase made it to my destination without having to wait for it to appear on the baggage claim conveyer.

## Bureaucracy

### Both of my passports, in protective cases

### Driving licence

### Photocopy of both passports, in a plastic folder, and of travel insurance certificate, in a plastic folder

This is somewhat of a hangover from my early days backpacking, back before there were backup copies of everything you need online. In those days you carried a photocopy of your passport away from your passport, so in the event that the passport went missing, you could still prove your identity and you still had all your passport information.

Nowadays, as I have everything stored securely in the cloud, the likelihood of me losing my passport _and_ losing access to my cloud services while still retaining photocopies is unlikely, but old habits die hard.

### UK GHIC

## Miscellaneous

### Disposable face mask

Covid might be over, but there's still a hangover of it in some places. For example, on the Bangkok subway and skytrain people still all wear masks and sometimes get uncomfortable when people aren't. If you're going to such a place, it's worth keeping one handy.

### Laundry net

Available for about £2 on eBay are these large, drawstring washing nets, which have two useful purposes.

They pack pretty much flat yet can act as a laundry basket, so are good for keeping your dirty clothes organised when you're staying somewhere.

On days that you're travelling and put all of your clothes in your suitcase, you need a way of keeping your dirty clothes separate from the clean. I travel will all my dirty clothes in my laundry net so I know what needs washing and what doesn't.

### Large plastic bag

This is unnecessary if you're only staying in places with washing machines, but in my experience, when you drop your clothes off at a launderette for a service wash, you never get them back in the same bag. If you drop them off in your laundry net, you'll probably never see that net again. I keep whatever bag my clothes get returned in for the next time I need to go to a launderette.

## Other items to consider

The above list is every item that I have with me. Constrained by a lack of space or funds or willingness to buy them, I don't have any of the following, but you might want to consider them.

### Swimming goggles
