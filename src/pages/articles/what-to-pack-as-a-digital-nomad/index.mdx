A list of every item that I own.

## My bags

I carry two bags with me:

A fake Swissgear rucksack, and a 63.5cm x 44.4cm x 29.2cm suitcase. Everything comfortably fits in these two bags with the suitcase weighing around 15kg.

## Fitness

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08LPYZV98'>Folding yoga mat</ExternalLink>, two <ExternalLink url='https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cork-yoga-brick/_/R-p-323475'>yoga blocks</ExternalLink> and a <ExternalLink url='https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cotton-yoga-strap/_/R-p-183211'>yoga strap</ExternalLink>

It might seem mad that roughly a third of my suitcase is taken up by a yoga mat and yoga blocks, and perhaps it is, but I would have a hard time justifying being digital nomad if I knew it was negatively impacting my long-term health compared to being settled.

So much of my lifestyle is driven by a fear of one day being old and immobile, and perhaps the biggest of those fears is losing my flexibility. To stave-off that inevitability I do yoga whenever I can, and I just wouldn't be able to do it as well without a mat and my yoga blocks.

My folding yoga mat packs flat into my suitcase, and even fits into my rucksack if I want to take it to a class outside of my room. I'm still waiting for someone to invent travel yoga blocks, so in the mean time I carry around these two bricks with me.

## Sustenance

Being a vegan digital nomad can greatly limit the places you can comfortably travel to, especially if you're going somewhere that getting an apartment isn't viable so you're limited to hotels, and hence have no cooking facilities. That leaves you limited to restaurants. In some places in the world veganism just isn't a thing, and in others there's no English for you to communicate what you want.

In such situations having your own equipment can be a lifesaver because you at least have the means to cut-up fruit and make a fruit salad, or to get some granola and soy milk from the supermarket.

If your diet is more liberal or you don't plan on going anywhere off the beaten path, these items won't be necessary, but from my experience you can have the confidence to go to more remote, less vegan-friendly places when you know that you can prepare limited foods on your own.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09B3L9XY5'>Personal blender</ExternalLink>

When space is limited, carrying around a blender in my suitcase might sound crazier than carrying two yoga blocks, but I use my blender a couple of times per day, no matter where in the world I am. I start and finish everyday with a fruit smoothie, and my health would be undoubtedly worse without it.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07NH42V2R'>Small chopping board</ExternalLink>

I've stayed in Airbnbs that have knives, but that don't have chopping boards. Having one of your own when in ill-equipped kitchens on when staying in hotels allows you to much more easily cut-up fruit, for example.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08FMFZ2NC'>Travel cutlery</ExternalLink>

You should get cultery in any Airbnb, but its much less likely in a hotel room. You've ordered a take-away and they didn't include cutlery? For as little space as it takes up, you'll be glad you have your own.

### <ExternalLink url='https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09WH3RY76'>Flat-pack silicone bowl</ExternalLink>

Primarily favoured by dogs, silicone bowls pack flat so they don't take up much space in your suitcase, but can be popped-out into a bowl shape whenever you feel like some granola or a fruit salad.

### Camping knife

When I was much younger and dumber, I went hitch-hiking through the wilderness of Canada. I bought my camping knife, with it's three-inch blade in case I got attacked by any grizzly bears.

Thankfully that never happened, because now I know what a grizzly bear is it turns out it wouldn't have been much help and I'd be much more dead. None-the-less I found my camping knife to be an incredibly useful tool, and it's been with me everywhere I've been in the world for the fifteen years since.

Once you know how, it's easier and faster to open cans with a knife than with a can opener, you're often going to find yourself needing to cut string or dig-out splinters or take-out screws. With a big of ingenuity, your knife can do all of that. It's probably not the best-suited knife for what I now need it for, which more often than not is cutting-up fruit, but we've been together too long, me and knifey.

### Knife sharpener

Back when I was living in Park City in Utah in 2010, I wandered into the Walmart and happened to see this little knife-sharpening tool. I think it cost about a dollar.

Opening enough cans can dull your knife, so I bought this little knife sharpener, and just like my knife, it's been with me ever since. Not only is it great for keeping knifey sharp, but one of the first things I do when I check-into a new Airbnb is sharpen all the knives. It's something that even the most attentive hosts seem to neglect, and can make cooking so much easier.

## Tech

### 14" 2023 M2 MacBook Pro with charger, <ExternalLink url='https://www.tomtoc.com/products/tomtoc-versatile-a13-360-protective-laptop-sleeve-for-14-new-macbook-pro-black?variant=43597005750502'>protective case</ExternalLink> and microfibre cloth

The most important item I own, my MacBook puts the digital into digital nomad.

### AirPods Pro

If you'd asked me two months ago, I'd have told you that the AirPods Pro are the most perfect product Apple's ever created. I've used mine extensively in the two and a half years I've owned them and the battery doesn't feel like it's degraded at all. They work seemlessly with my phone, my Mac and my Apple TV, so in a typical day I could use them to play some motivational songs while going for a run or to the gym, to listen to a podcast while having lunch, to play nature sounds while meditating, and then to listen to whatever show I'm watching on Netflix in the evening. It wouldn't be uncommon for me to use them four hours per day.

A couple of months ago though, right after arriving in Bucharest, I started having an issue when my left ear became completely blocked with earwax, and my right ear was feeling a little full too. It took me three weeks to make the connection to my AirPods, but eventually I decided that wearing them so much, I was continually pushing ear wax back into my ear every time I put them in, and stopping ear wax from falling out by wearing them. Having been basically deaf in one ear for three weeks, within three or four days of ceasing using my AirPods, my ears cleared and I've had perfect hearing ever since.

They're still a great product, but I don't give them much use anymore, because I didn't really enjoy barely being able to hear for almost all of my time in Bucharest.
