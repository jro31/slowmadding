The question of what to pack in your suitcase as a digital nomad comes up a lot. I've seen articles where people list 'key' or 'important' items, but they often leave a lot out. So what I'm going to do is list every single item that I own. This is all I have with me, so is a definitive list of what you need.

Obviously your own list will vary based on your personality and how you envision your digital nomad lifestyle. For example, as you'll see I dedicate a lot of space in my suitcase to health and fitness. If you don't plan on doing much exercise, then these items can be replaced or removed altogether.

It's also worth noting that one of my motivations for being a digital nomad, is I hate the winter. It's cold, dark and depressing. My intention as a digital nomad is to chase the summer, and spend absolutely no time in a place where it's not t-shirt and shorts weather. The clothes in my suitcase reflect this. If your plan is to work from coffee shops in Antarctica, then again, adjust accordingly. What works for me may not work for you.

Throughout this article, I'll add links to some of the specific items that I have on Amazon or other sites. This is for no reason other than simplicity in detailing the exact item that I own. I receive no commission or benefit of any kind from adding these links, and couldn't give two shit if you click on those links or not; they're just for illustrative purposes.

## My bags

I carry two bags with me:

A fake Swissgear rucksack that I bought in a Thai market in 2015. I've used it pretty much everyday for eight years now without an issue. I highly doubt an actual Swissgear rucksack would have lasted this well. I don't know the exact dimensions, but it can comfortably fit a 13" laptop in if that helps.

My suitcase is also a cheap knockoff from a Thai market, although I don't think it even pretends to be a fancy brand. I only got it in 2022, but it's so far lasting much better than the more expensive fancy suitcase that I had with me when I left the UK.

I say fancy, it came from TK Maxx at about an 80% discount, but it at least pretended to be posh.

My current suitcase's dimensions are H 25"/63.5cm, W 17.5"/44.4cm, D 11.5"/29.2cm. When full, it weighs annoyingly close to 15kg. On some airport scales it weighs just below 15kg, but on some it weighs more, so I always have to pay for 20kg of check-in luggage just to be safe.

The items below fit comfortably into my two bags.
