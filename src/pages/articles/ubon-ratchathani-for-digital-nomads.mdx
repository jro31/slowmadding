Ubon Ratchathani is one of Isaan's 'big four' cities, although it's noticably smaller than the other three (Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen and Udon Thani). It's located in the east of the country, about 50km from the Laos border.

## Who is Ubon Ratchathani suitable for?

I was asked on multiple occasions if I'd gone to Ubon as an aspirant monk. That's a common reason why some foreigners end up here. It always made me feel a little sheepish when I had to respond that nope, just here to wander around and get to know the city.

Once AI has robbed me of my career and job prospects, becoming a monk is definitely one of the options at the top of my list, and Ubon might just be the place to do so.

If you're not planning to train for ordination, then Ubon is a pretty uneventful city. The nightlife here is very dry - this is not a place to come if you want to party.

It's a nice city to wander around and to relax in. There are many coffee shops here, but I didn't find there was too much "to do". If you're someone that needs to be busy and to be sociable all the time, Ubon is not for you. If you want to relax and just exist for a bit, you'll feel right at home.

## How affordable is Ubon Ratchathani?

Ubon is cheap, even by Isaan standards. I was paying 550 baht per night for my room. A small bottle of Leo in the one foreigner-aimed by in town is just 65 baht (all the time, not just at happy hour), and there's a local เจ restaurant where meals start at 15 baht (rice with one choice from the buffet). If you're on a tight budget, you can live very, very cheaply in Ubon.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Ubon Ratchathani?

Definitely don't expect English to be spoken. You will encounter many people that don't speak any, but I found that most people spoke enough that you can get by with only English in shops and restaurants, just don't hold-out for deep conversations.

## What is the layout of Ubon Ratchathani?

Ubon's layout it weird. <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/B9LcfZWguZSfDKyg6'>The airport</ExternalLink>'s in the middle of the city, with the entrance in what you'd basically consider the city centre. Yet for some reason the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/fx8qfmiPNJnniuzt6'>railway station</ExternalLink> is way off to the south of the city, across the river, and the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/KVonjhUdgKWpDNEG6'>bus terminal</ExternalLink> is way off in the north.

As there were no trains at convenient times for when I wanted to leave Ubon, I wandered up to the bus terminal one day to try and figure-out the times of buses to Buriram. As is standard in Thailand, there is no central ticketing area, and instead you have to deal with multiple companies. But there seemed to be about five different companies with buses to Buriram, and none of them could understand that I didn't want to take a bus that day, I was just asking about times.

I was there at about 2pm, and what I did learn was that it was more than three hours until the next bus, at which point I just said fuck it, a 7am train doesn't sound so bad after all.

## Going to immigration in Ubon Ratchathani

In my many years in Thailand, I've had to deal with immigration offices in many provinces, and I was in Ubon this time when my 90-day report was due, so I wandered down to the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/tJDvupvyNvLH3BcGA'>Ubon Ratchathani Immigration Office</ExternalLink>.

Not only is the location here pretty convenient, being walking distance from the city centre, but I've never been to an immigration office where the immigration officers are so relaxed and helpful.

In other provinces they seem to make it their mission to be as unhelpful and as short-tempered as possible. I've literally had my documents thrown back at me before. Here they were really calm, really helpful, they were smiling the whole time. It's the exact opposite of what I typically expect when going to immigration in Thailand.

If you do have an upcoming 90-day report or visa extension, then timing it for when you're in Ubon isn't the worst idea. It's rare to leave an immigration office in a good mood.

I even got my documents photocopied on the way to immigration, at a <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/fugm6R6HHt5A9uVr7'>copy shop</ExternalLink> across the street, and you know what it cost me? One baht per copy, so three baht in total.

I've literally never bought anything that only cost three baht. I felt bad paying. If they'd rounded it up to 10 baht I wouldn't have minded.

## Being sociable in Ubon Ratchathani

A fever that I caught mid-way through my stay precluded me from being as sociable (drinking as much beer) as I like to do, but even so I can tell you that the bar scene in Ubon is a little tame.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uuq9YXZ3YazzVtgE6'>Wrong Way Cafe</ExternalLink> is the only foreigner-aimed bar in town. It's quite a fun place, and beers start at 65 baht for a small bottle of Leo, so you can sit here and drink all night without spending much. The atmosphere isn't going to blow you away, but drink enough and you won't notice.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/QYConGeC4gz9VAEo7'>Heisenberg's</ExternalLink> is a craft beer bar. The draft beers start at 69 baht, and none of them cost more than 140. They're all local beers, so it's quite fun working your way through the list. The staff speak very little English, but you can get by.

I didn't ever make it to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/bEqJQNJm8vGw62Wc7'>Ubon Tap Taste House Craft Beer & Foods</ExternalLink>, but it was quite a fun looking place that was on my list to try. The other place I never made it to, was there's a line of restaurants/bars along the west bank of the Huai Wang Nong lake (start at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/bEqJQNJm8vGw62Wc7'>7-11</ExternalLink> and walk north). I came here for a walk on my first night in Ubon and thought that some of them looked quite fun, but I never ended up making it out here for a drink. Like with Ubon Tap Taste House, it's something to try when I'm next in town.

Outside of going and sitting in bars, I found little in Ubon for meeting new people, but there was a poster above the urinal in Wrong Way Cafe advertising the '<ExternalLink url='https://www.facebook.com/ubonhash'>Ubon Hash House Harriers</ExternalLink>' which seems to be a running (drinking) club that meet on the first saturday of every month, so if you happen to be in Ubon then, give them a look.

## Things I don't like about Ubon Ratchathani

## Where to run in Ubon Ratchathani

During my time in Ubon Ratchathani, <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/yVeTUTFXCBH1sydF6'>Huai Wang Nong</ExternalLink> lake was going through a big revamp, and they'd drained most of the water from the lake and dug-up all the rounds around it. As such, less than half of the lake was actually safely runnable, but even just what was available was really good for running.

The roads and pavements that have been built didn't yet have any markings on them, but the pavements were really wide and the roads had barely any vehicles. Running as far as you could in both directions got you to over 4km, so apart from having to turn around and re-trace your steps, this was a really great place to run.

Once the construction work on the lake is complete and you can go all the way around, it'll be an amazing place to run. I'd guess a circuit would be about 8km. Although it didn't look like they'd be finished any time soon.

There's also an outdoor workout area at the south-east corner of the lake that includes a pull-up bar.

I didn't feel the need to run anywhere other than Huai Wang Nong lake, but in walking down there, I thought the riverside looked quite a good spot for running. Very peaceful, wide pavements.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/mGPTgtmrpCm5bj5i8'>Nong Bua Public Park</ExternalLink> is a way out of the city centre, on the way up to the bus station (my walk to the bus station was when I discovered it). If you're staying in this part of town or if you have your own transportation, it includes a running track, and you might have a bit more shade than running at the lake, if that matters to you.
