When I was recently planning my trip from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), I had to pull together information from a lot of different sources to find everything that I wanted to know.

That was a massive pain, so I'm putting it all together here to save you the trouble.

This article is split into three sections:

## Travelling to Ho Chi Minh City

Although there are other options, such as direct flights, I'm only going to detail travelling to Ho Chi Minh City by bus. It's more economically and envrionementally responsible, and when you consider the time needed at either end waiting around at, and getting to/from the airports for an international flight, there's very little advantage in flying.

There are multiple bus companies offering services from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh, but if you spend any time on Google researching, you'll soon find that Giant Ibis is continually recommended as the best one.

What I couldn't decide, was whether this was very smart marketing from them with some articles strategically well-placed in the Google rankings, whether one person wrote an article recommending them and everyone else just followed, or whether they are just that much better than the competition.

Having now travelled with them, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's not the latter.

Were they bad? I've had worse, but it was hardly the luxury travel that all these articles claimed it to be.

Firstly to buy a ticket, you *can* buy online at <ExternalLink url='https://www.giantibis.com/'>giantibis.com</ExternalLink>. Their site is absolute garbage on mobile, so if you are going to book online, make sure to do it on a computer. Personally though, I still prefer to buy tickets in person because it gives you the opportunity to ask any questions about travel time, the border crossing, the number of stops etc., that you can't get online. I'll do my best to answer all those questions here, but even just for printing-off and checking over my Vietnam visa to make sure it had all the details correct, it was worth going into the ticket office.

And it gets a little confusing, because the place where you buy the ticket is no longer where you catch the bus. The ticket office is located <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/eVdWcRdebnHKTk8QA'>here</ExternalLink>. A ticket from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City is $39, and you can pay by card. The staff speak pretty good English and are very helpful in answering any questions you have. Be mindful that there are a lot of surrounding businesses offering bus tickets, so be sure to go into the one for Giant Ibis.

The place that you catch the bus is <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/PAuvgadUBtMUo7jW8'>here</ExternalLink>. It's a little out of the way, but a tuk-tuk can get you there pretty quickly. There isn't much going on once you've crossed the river, so you shouldn't expect to any traffic.

Before continuing, I'm going to add the following caveat that might have led me to remember this journey with more disdain that I normally would. But you know how, before you catch a flight or train or a bus, you look around the waiting room, and you spot the one person where you think to yourself *"fuck, I hope I'm not sitting next to that person"*?

On this occasion the Gods were not with me, because it was my turn to be sacrificed.

We spoke briefly, and this was a very nice man. A lawyer in fact, travelling with his whole family in South-East Asia, so you'd assume not short of money. But for whatever reason, he just didn't wash. You could see from across the waiting room that his jeans hadn't been washed in weeks, probably months. He had a very overwhelming aroma of urine, and to top it all off, he was rather rotund, to the point that in order to not touch him, and I didn't want to touch him, I had to spend the entire journey curved over into the aisle, so spent the entire journey in considerable discomfort, and had a bad back for more than a week afterwards.

I usually look forward to long journey like this, because I can relax in my seat, listen to podcasts, read my book, maybe watch a movie.

Not this time, I didn't get any of that done. I spent the entire journey leaning into the aisle, trying to breathe as little as possible. I would hope that no one else has to endure that, and that your trip to Ho Chi Minh City is far more pleasant. But I thought this poignant to add, as it may have tainted my opinion of this journey.

I always go for aisle seats. I like to have the freedom to stretch-out a bit more, and the freedom to get up quickly and at a moment's notice. Particularly when we arrive or when we stop somewhere, I don't want to be waiting for the person in the seat next to me to be polite and let everyone else past, I just want to get out. However, with Giant Ibis I would recommend getting a window seat, for the simple reason that only the window seats have electical ports to charge your devices.

I was able to thread my charger underneath the seat so that I could charge my phone while sitting in the aisle seat, but it certainly wasn't as comfortable as being right next to the plug, so if you have any intention of using your phone to watch movies, then get the window.

I'd been told that this journey would take 6 to 7 hours. The reality was it was almost 10. For some reason, we took about an hour driving in a huge zig-zag across Phnom Penh before leaving the city. I think they were expecting to pick-up other passengers who weren't there.

It's worth noting that Giant Ibis buses don't have toilets. According to the Giant Ibis website, *"they take up a lot of space and smell bad."* There were, I believe, only supposed to be three scheduled stops on this journey, but we had to make two more for people who couldn't hold their bladders. These delays meant that we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City much closer to rush hour, turning our 6 to 7 hour journey into an almost 10 hour one.

Don't expect much at these stops, particularly if you're looking for vegan food. If you're lucky you'll be able to get some crisps or some nuts or some fruit, but I'd be fully prepared to go the day without being able to buy anything to eat. I'm fairly certain that the bus company or the bus driver gets a kick-back for stopping at the particular spots that we do, because they definitely don't choose them for the facilities.

The most important part of the journey though, is getting comfortably across the border and into Vietnam, and this is where the extra money you pay to Giant Ibis becomes worth it.

At one of these stops, we were joined by another bus company called Danh Danh, who also ply the route from Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh. And remembering the torment that I was presently enduring, it was with envy that I looked at this Danh Danh bus and saw that they had three seats per row instead of four, so anyone travelling alone got an armchair to themselves, with no one sitting next to them. What you don't get on a Danh Danh bus is an attendant that speaks English, which for knowing how long you're stopping somewhere, or more importantly, for what's going on at the border, is priceless.

Our English-speaking attendant handled all the visa stuff. We all got herded around like cattle, but at the end of it, everyone got stamped-out of Cambodia and stamped-into Vietnam without having to speak to a border agent or do very much at all.

The whole process took around an hour. We all got stamped out of Cambodia incredibly quickly, then got taken to a restaurant for lunch in no man's land between Cambodia and Vietnam while the attendant kept our passports. After lunch, we all got back on the bus and were driven to Vietnam immigration, where we got called forward one at a time as this one immigration official stamped everyone's passports. Once you were through, you had to put your luggage through a scanner, but I don't even think anyone was there looking at it. And without having to do anything or answer any questions, we were all into Vietnam.
