## How long is a Cambodian tourist visa?

You might have read that a Cambodian tourist visa is 30 days. Everyone I've ever spoken to says a Cambodian tourist visa is for 30 days. If you look online, including on any government websites, they'll say a Cambodian tourist visa is 30 days.

A Cambodian tourist visa is not 30 days.

What I learned the hard way is that when you enter Cambodia, the border official will give you a visa until the same day of the next month, minus one day. For example, if you enter Cambodia on December 15th, your visa will be until one month later minus one day, so January 14th. That means that your visa will be either 30 or 31 days depending on the length of the month in which you enter the country.

Except if you enter in February. I entered in February.

Mistakenly believing that my visa would be for 30 days, prior to arriving I had a flight booked out of the country 30 days after my day of arrival. So when the border agent gave me a visa for 28 days, I didn't have a good time.

I was entering the country by bus, and the bus company took care of everyone's visas and didn't give us back our passports until we were back on the bus and far away from the border, so I didn't get the opportunity to query this discrepancy with the border agent. I ask online though, and it turns-out this wasn't a one-off. Whether this is how the length of all visas is determined, or whether some actually are 30 days no matter which month you enter, I'm not sure. But I did find several other people online who had also entered in February and only been given a visa for 28 days.

I'd been in Cambodia a couple of months prior to this, arriving in December. I hadn't paid much attention to my visa at this time, but when I looked back and counted, arriving in a 31 day month I had been given a 31 day visa.

This is only really relevant to people arriving in February, but if you are, don't make the same mistake I made and make travel plans assuming you'll be allowed to stay in the country for 30 days. You may well only be permitted to stay for 28.

## Do you need to get a visa extension?

So you've come into Cambodia in February, you've booked non-refundable hotels and a flight out of the country for 30 days later on the mistaken assumption that being able to count to thirty is a requirement to get a job as a border official in Cambodia, and now you're only allowed to stay in the country for 28 days. What then?

The way I looked at it was I had three options:

1. I rearrange my travel plans to leave after 28 days instead of 30
2. I leave the country and re-enter on a new visa
3. I overstay my by two days
4. I get an extension to my tourist visa

I quickly decided against rearranging my travel plans. I had a non-refundable flight out of Cambodia already booked at a cost of about £80, and a non-refundable Airbnb for 30 days at about £20 per night. To shorten my stay by two days, I'd need to rebook this flight and rebook the last two nights accommodation in another country, so it'd cost me about £120, so fuck that shit.

I also decided against leaving and re-entering the country. The time and cost of travelling across the border and back, including the cost of a new visa (and the cost of the visa to enter this other country if going to Vietnam or Laos), potentially with an overnight stay just wasn't worth it.

Realistically, my choices were to overstay my visa by two days, or to extend my current visa.

Of all the advice I sought, including from an agent who I'd pay to get a visa extension, everyone told me to just overstay for two days. The fine for an overstay is $10 per day, so overstaying by two days would cost $20 _if_ they cared at all. The feeling was very much that if you overstay by less than 30 days, then no one really cares. It's overstaying by more than that where you'll have problems.

Apart from my rigidity in mostly obeying the law (I've never overstayed in any country, despite travelling for half my life), I didn't like the idea of overstaying for a couple of reasons.

The first was that although everyone said that immigration almost certainly wouldn't care if I overstayed by less than 30 days, no one could tell me definitively that they wouldn't care. I could happen to get an immigration official with a stick up his arse that day who decides he's going to ban me from re-entering Cambodia for a set period of time, and that would be problematic.

Given the amount of time I spend in Thailand, having a country with which it shares a land border of which I can quickly pop across when my Thai visa expires is quite important.

Myanmar isn't really viable for that given the current situation there, and I wouldn't go to Malaysia because fuck Malaysia, which leaves me with just Laos and Cambodia. Cambodia has the better Internet speeds of the two, which is important to me as a remote software engineer, so is my preferred choice. If I suddenly lost the ability to jump across the border to Cambodia, that would complicate my travel plans.

The other reason was that I was flying from Cambodia to Thailand, with the intent of getting a Thai visa waiver. A requirement of a Thai visa waiver is that you've booked travel out of Thailand again. I hadn't.

This can be problematic in two places. If you get denied entry to a country, the airline that brought you there gets fined, which is why airlines can be a bit finicky about letting you board the plane if you don't meet all visa requirments. This is the most likely pain point, but you can also technically be denied entry at Thai immigration.

That's pretty unlikely. I've had Thai immigration officials ask me if I've got outbound travel booked before, I've said no. She then asked me how long I was planning on staying. _"Dunno, however long you let me"_ I replied. The woman just smiled and stamped me into the country. As long as you're not a dick, they don't really care. I've entered Thailand many, many times and never had outbound travel booked, and it's never been a problem. And I've always been able to point to the fact that I've never overstayed in a country before if I do get questioned.

That's a very hard sell if I'm trying to board a flight having just overstayed in Cambodia, so I envisioned unlikely but possible problems when boarding my flight if I overstayed, so I opted for option 4: Getting a visa extension.
