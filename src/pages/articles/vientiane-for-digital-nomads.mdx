A major city right across the border from Thailand, Laos' capital Vientiane is the obvious place to go when your Thai visa expires and you need to get out the country, especially if you have designs to return. That is why many people come here (that was why I first came here in 2011), but Vientiane is a destination in its own right.

Having not been here since [2015] I was excited to return, this time as a digital nomad, having enjoyed my previous visits. And while it's a city with a lot of potential, there's a lot that makes Vientiane not very digital nomad friendly.

While many nationalities can get a visa on arrival, that is only for 30 days making it a hard place to come with any long-term plans. That visa can be extended for up to 30 more days, but the combined costs mean to stay here for 60 days will be over $100 USD and you'll twice have to deal with immigration.

Unofficially, according to a long-term resident I met while drunk one night, a one year working visa can be obtained for $400 USD without too much trouble, so while longer-term stays are possible, I can't vouch for how easy this is.

The Internet in Vientiane in shockingly bad considering Thailand is just over the river and has some of the fastest Internet in the world. Some more unverified drunken information I obtained is that the Internet used to be much faster here, but after a spat between Thai and Laotian officials, it mysteriously got much slower. Whatever the reason, Vientiane has the most unstable Internet connections I've used in modern times.

It's also not really a fun city to get around. I'm someone who likes to walk everywhere, and in Vientiane, residents use the pavements as a car park, so to walk anywhere you have to continually go out into the road and avoid the traffic, which is very frustrating. There are plenty of tuk-tuks hanging around, but as Vientiane attracts so many gullible tourists, the tuk-tuks often won't take you anywhere for any less than an exorbitant rate. For example, when I moved to my second hotel in Laos, to go between the two rooms was about a 25 minute walk. As I have a wheeled suitcase and as the pavements are so uneven, this was a rare occasion that I tried to take a tuk-tuk.

Firstly I went onto the Kokkok app, which is a ride-hailing app, and the quote on there for this trip was 7,000 kip. There was no availability, so I went to the first tuk-tuk I saw outside of my hotel, and for this same trip he quoted me 100,000 kip, more than fourteen times the price, and he refused to budge on that price when I tried to negotiate.

I can't blame him either, because he won't have to wait long until a tourist shows up who is willing to pay. But unless you're willing to pay absurdly high fares, getting around by tuk-tuk isn't really viable either. I ended up walking.

There is a bus network in Vientiane, but it seems pretty sparse and almost unused, even by locals.

Coupled with being unpleasant to get around, there isn't really any green space in Vientiane. No parks of note within the city, and nowhere nice to run. I couldn't tell you anywhere outdoor in Vientiane that's pleasant to be.

I also found it to be one of the worst major cities I've been to from a social perspective. There aren't many events going on, and going and sitting in the bars alone, I found that people weren't especially sociable or willing to meet others. Some were, and alcohol is the great equaliser in that regard, but in other places in the world I found meeting strangers in bars much more seamless.

That's the bad. Vientiane does have some things going for it as well.

Firstly, it's a great city for food, and is very vegan-friendly. I'd spent three weeks in Isaan in northern Thailand before coming here, and there if you want vegan food, you're pretty much limited to Thai food. Neither will appreciate me saying this, but Thai food and Laotian food is exactly the same, so I was very thankful that there are a lot of other cuisines available, including western vegan food. The monotony of only eating local food was starting to get to me.

Apart from the tuk-tuks, it's a very affordable city where you can get a comfortable hotel room for a month for less than $600 USD, and it's one of the safest places I've ever been. To steal the Mongol quote, _"a maiden bearing a nugget of gold on her head could wander safely throughout the realm."_ There really are no safety concerns here as the people are very, very friendly and trusting.

I guess the best way to sum it up, is if you're someone fairly inactive who likes to spend their afternoons in cafes and coffee shops, then you'll probably like Vientane. It's slow-paced and there's no shortage of places to laze away the day.

If you're more active and you like to be outdoors a lot, then it's not so great. I really hated that there was nowhere outdoors that I could get away from the traffic.
