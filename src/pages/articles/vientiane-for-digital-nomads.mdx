Putting the towel over the bedroom windows like this meant that at least I could leave the black-out curtains in the living room open without the worry of people being able to see in while I slept. Rather than none, it allowed in a minimal amount of natural light, but it wasn't helped by the windows on the bedroom being tinted. If you're someone who likes to rise with daylight, as I do, then I cannot recommend staying here.",

I've never seen one of them before, but I didn't get to try it as the restaurant food in Vientiane is so good, and the supermarkets less so. Importantly it includes a kettle.",
