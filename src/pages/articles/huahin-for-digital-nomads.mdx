Huahin is a town famous for being the favoured holiday destination of the late king Rama IX, and as such has a reputation of being a beach destination in Thailand for locals, compared to the likes of Koh Samui or Phuket which are primarily visited by foreigners.

That felt true on my first visit to Huahin in 2016, as a short break while living in Bangkok. By the time I returned as a digital nomad in 2023 I found that Huahin had become a haven for foreign retirees. Put another way, many old white men now reside here, and when a town in Thailand becomes inundated with male retirees who have a much higher disposable income than the average Thai, the town will change to part them from that money, much to their delight.

Don't make the mistake of thinking Huahin is equivalent to Pattaya or Patong in the services it offers; it's not even close. This is still a very sleepy town in comparison. However, a couple of new and thriving bar areas have sprung up since my first visit, and there's no shortage of massage parlours.

My first visit to Huahin as a digital nomad was marred by a sprained ankle that I gave myself on my first full day, which rendered me immobile for much of my stay. Part of the motivation to return for my second visit as a digital nomad was to have a redeeming experience, but it was also that Huahin's just a nice, relaxed place to be. There's really not much going on, but if you like to merely exist, as I do, then Huahin's a nice place to exist.

That, and it's the quickest and easiest place that I've found in Thailand to <Link href='/articles/getting-a-visa-extension-in-huahin'>get a visa extension</Link> so it's worth the trip down here just for that.

Huahin is known for its beach. If you come here, that's probably why. However if that's your motivation, I'd say don't bother.

I'm not really a big fan of beaches to begin with, so perhaps it's not my opinion you should seek, but to me they're just sandy and hot. There are only two reasons that I like going to the beach.

The first is that it can be nice to swim in the sea sometimes, and the second is the serenity of the sound of the water. A quiet beach is a perfect place to meditate. Based on that, you know the best way to ruin a perfecltly good beach? Jet-skis.

The beach in Huahin is long and straight. It's not like in a cove, where you're protected from sound. On a straight beach, a jet-ski two miles away still makes an endless, annoying whirring sound like you're on a racetrack. On Huahin beach the endless “waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh” of jet-skis drowns-out the sound of the ocean, so forget about going there to relax. And seeing as the scholars that ride these jet-skis feel the need to ride them close to the shore, then you can forget about having a relaxing swim as well.

Maybe out of the town there are some quieter bays; I haven't really explored this, but the main tourist beach? An absolute waste of time. It's away from the beach that Huahin is a pleasant place.

It's not exciting, there really isn't very much going on, but it's a nice place to exist peacefully.

## Where I stayed

### Baan Yokmhanee

<AccommodationAddress name='250/199 Soi 90 Petchkasem Rd' url='https://goo.gl/maps/n6MZk993wTytMqou9' />

<AccommodationTable details={baanYokmhaneeFirstStayDetails} />

<AccommodationTable details={baanYokmhaneeSecondStayDetails} />

The Internet here is dog shit. I love everything else about this place.

The location of Baan Yokmhanee is really good. You're about a three minute walk from the beach (albeit across a main road) so if you fancy a morning run or to sit on the beach for some reason, you really don't have to go far. There are several restaurants not more than a couple of minutes away, with a 7-11 and the soi 94 bar area not much farther.

The bars are almost dangerously close if I'm honest. When it's that easy to get to a bar, you often find yourself going to a bar, so treat that as a positive or a negative depending on your outlook, but I have had some fun there.

You're about a five minute walk from the Market Village shopping mall, which has a Lotus's supermarket among other shops, and from there you can catch a minibus to Mo Chit in Bangkok. Blueport shopping mall is about a 10-15 minute walk and is home to Huahin immigration in case you need to extend your visa, and that's where you can catch minibuses to Ekkamai in Bangkok, so you have a lot of useful things within easy walking distance.

There is a gym in Market Village (Jetts Fitness) but it's very overpriced for short-term visitors; a day pass costs 500 baht. A little further away, down soi 88, is Body Fit 88 which has any equipment you need for a good workout, and only costs 190 baht for a day pass. I went there a couple of times. To walk to the centre of town from the room takes about 25 minutes.

As for the hotel itself, the room is huge. It has a double bed, a sofa, a desk and a separate dining table, a bathroom, a sort of kitchen, and a tonne a space beyond this. You have loads of space in the room if you like to exercise at home like I do.

I say a 'sort of kitchen' because it's more just the space where a kitchen would be. You have a surface, a sink, a refrigerator, some cutlery, a couple of bowls and a hot water dispenser, but there isn't actually any cooking equipment. No oven, no stove and no microwave.

I find the staff to be really friendly and attentive. Despite booking through a different platform, come my second stay they'd remembered my name and saved me the same room as my first stay (408) to stay in again, which was a nice touch. You don't often get remembered as a digital nomad.

The room is made-up daily, which is useful if you get sand everywhere. For all of these things the room is perfect, particularly for the price (although there are cheaper rooms in Huahin). The downside is that the Internet is shocking. It's a connection that you have to sign-into through a login page, and which logs you out everytime you put your phone or your laptop down.

Seriously, you put down your phone to go to the toilet, and by the time you come back you have to go through the login page again.

When you are logged-in the speeds are perfectly respectable, with download and upload speeds of roughly 50mbps, but it's just a pain to have to login every time. The saving grace is that I was able to get a very strong 5G signal in my room (AIS), so most of the time I wouldn't bother connecting to the wifi and would just use my data.

Apart from that, this room is close to perfect from a digital nomad perspective. Some cooking equipment would be welcome, otherwise the location and the facilities are really spot-on. As this is an article aimed at digital nomads, it's hard to recommend a room when the Internet is so bad, but I do really like this place.

It's worth putting-up with the shitty Internet in order to stay here. I'd gladly stay again.

## Where to get vegan food in Huahin

While it's not as barren as some of the non-touristy towns in Thailand, the vegan offerings in Huahin are yet to catch-up with the increased foreign presence and the selection of restaurants is still fairly dire.

Several restaurants have one or two vegan options, but there are only two restaurants that I'd describe as truly vegan-friendly.

### Huahin Vegan Cafe & Wine

Aptly named Huahin Vegan, this place is as good as it gets for vegan food in Huahin. It's a fully vegan restaurant, as you can probably tell from the name, and the menu is a mix of local and foreign foods, some of which I'm not sure fit neatly into one type of cuisine. Tortilla pizza? Is that Mexican or Italian?

It also has a good mix of healthy and unhealthy, and as I'm a greedy fucker, I'd usually get two meals each time I came here. Something healthy and something less so. Prices obviously vary by item, but typically are in the range of 150 baht for each dish, so you can come here and get a salad for 150 baht, a smoothie for 150 baht, and something else for 150 baht. That's enough to last you for the day for 450 baht.

If you're not like me and like to only eat one meal at a time, then you can spend less than 300 baht.

Huahin Vegan is located on the ground floor of the Huahin Shopping Mall (not sure how they come up with these names), but as it's in the front corner of the shopping mall, you can also see it from the street.

They can feel a little under-staffed at busy times, as they typically only have one person working front-of-house who's responsible for all table service and making all drinks, so be prepared to wait if you come for lunch or dinner. Other than that, it's a really good quality restaurant and a God-send to an otherwise fairly dire vegan-scene in Huahin.

### Veggie Tales

Given the distance from my room, right on the other side of town, I didn't even make it to Veggie Tales on my first digital nomad stay in Huahin due to my lack of mobility. That's a shame because on my second stay I walked down here a couple of times, and on both it was worth it.

Despite its name, it's not actually a vegetarian restaurant. The menu is split into pesco vegetarian, lacto-ovo vegetarian and vegan. Or to use normal words, fish, vegetarian and vegan. Vegan items therefore are very clearly labelled, so you can be confident in what you're ordering. The food they offer is a mix of Thai and western, with Thai probably dominating the menu slightly, although it's a big menu so there are plenty of non-Thai offerings if you've had enough of Thai food. All that I ordered was really high quality, and it's pretty cheap as well. I didn't have anything here that cost more than 120 baht, so you can order a few items without breaking the bank.

It's situated down a residential soi north of the city centre, and is an extension of what feels like a family home. While there is a non-air conditioned indoor area, the majority of tables are outside. It's a beautiful, very tranquil garden to sit in, and on both my visits I was the only customer so it was very relaxing, though being outdoors I'd be wary of coming here at mosquito time.

As with Huahin vegan, it's a blessing Veggie Tales is here given the lack of vegan-friendly alternatives in Huahin. You may find yourself eating here a lot, and that's no bad thing.

## Where to run in Huahin

As I was rendered a cripple for much of my first stay, and only had one run on my second (mostly due to crippling hangovers), I feel a bit of a charlatan writing a section on running in Huahin, but as I've run on the beach twice, I can attest to running there at least.

On both occasions I went straight to the beach from my room and headed south, turning around after about 2.5km to make a 5km run. On the first of these I think I could have run twice as far without running out of beach, and gone an equal distance in the opposite direction, so you really can pick your distance. On the second, when the tide was higher, some parts of the beach were getting covered in water, so run at low tide if you want a long run (or just go backwards and forwards a lot).

I did the first of these runs barefoot, which isn't something new to me, but I did find it gave me some quite nasty blisters. I'm not sure if that's due to the granularity of the sand here, or whether my feet were just being little bitches. Come my second run I wore trainers, which was fine except with a higher tide, I did have to run through a bit of water.

Since I first arrived here I've had designs on running up the mountains that you can see from town, and I've been assured by some locals that you can run up them. As I'm yet to make it to these mountains I can't testify to this, but they are a possible option if you don't want to run on the beach.

One day I will make it up those mountains and update this article!

## Being sociable in Huahin

There's good news and bad news when it comes to being sociable in Huahin.

The bad news is that I've never found any kind of event in Huahin that's designed for people to meet each other. While I've been here I've seen nothing on Meetup, Facebook or Google.

The good news is that there are a lot of people very open to getting to know other people here, so by just going and sitting in a bar you'll be chatting to someone in no time.

My favourite area is the cluster of bars on <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/aDgpxUTPus5Gai4E7'>soi 94</ExternalLink>. These are a mix of 'girlie bars' and normal bars, so pick your poison. It's a fun area to go and hangout and have a few beers, and as most bars seat less than a dozen people, if you want to request they play something on the TV (such as a specific football match), they will most likely oblige. I was able to get a bar to play Crystal Palace vs Everton one Saturday night, despite Arsenal and Man United having games at the same time.

Another area is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/r8MLzPgoX2sQtfdN9'>soi 80</ExternalLink>, which is a street of almost nothing but bars. I have been for a couple of drinks down here, but I don't really like it. There seem to be many more bars than there are customers to support them, so you can't walk down the street without being hassled.

The centre of town is a mix of these areas, and starts from <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/dc6gJdB6FGQDb2a1A'>soi Bintabaht</ExternalLink> and goes out from there. It's a mix of girlie bars and normal bars, but like soi 80, has been uncomfortably quiet on both of my visits to Huahin, so not especially enjoyable.

I have met some interesting people there, but I'd recommend soi 94 out of the three of these. It's the most consistently busy and relaxed of these areas. You can go there without really being hassled, which isn't true of soi 80 or soi Bintabaht.

You'll find that most bars close by 2am (some at 1am), but as some have paid sufficient bribes, they can stay open as late as they want, so with a bit of searching you can find somewhere that you can drink throughout the night, which is always a bit dangerous and explains the hangovers.
