This is the (very long) story of the series of events and decisions that led me to believe that choosing the digital nomad lifestyle was right for me. [Skip to the bottom](#) TODO for the ultimate deciding factors.

## What led me to start travelling?

I guess that everything that's happened in my life and every decision I've ever made has led me to where I am today, but I want to start in 2003. I was a 17 year old rebellious teenage doing pretty much everything in my power to ensure I failed my A-level exams and didn't get the grades I needed to go to university. Luckily I'd accumulated enough knowledge before reaching that phase to pull me through my exams anyway, but I was now far from the straight-A student that I had been before grades mattered.

Even at this age I paid little mind to the customary way of doing things, and while the usual step was to go from here to university, I'd spent every bit of my life that I could remember to this point, in education, and the thought of immediately signing-up to four more years kind of sickened me.

Even as a child I'd wanted power over my own finances. Then until now, I hate having any reliance on others, so I'd got my first job as soon as it was legal. That was a paper-round when I was 13. At 6am every morning, before school, I'd pull myself out of bed, cycle to the nearby newsagent, and for £2.20 per day would deliver the daily newspapers to various houses.

Contrary to how I am today when the earlier I get to bed the better, at 13 I stayed up late every night, so getting up at 6am every morning, I spent most of my life exhausted, and the decline in my school grades testified to this, although I kind of lost all interest in learning around now anyway, so maybe the tiredness masked an overall lack of motivation.

After a year or so I grew weary of being constantly tired so moved-onto delivering the local free newspaper. That might look like an easy job when you see people doing it, but unlike in my previous round where there were just a few stops, these free newspapers have to go to _every_ house and I had three different routes. It would take several hours every week, but the money was pretty good. For a 14 year old.

About a year later, a new restaurant opened-up around the corner from where I lived in south-west London, and when me and a few friends were walking past one day, we noticed a sign advertising for help in the kitchen. Looking back, having this mob of teenagers come in it's amazing we got anywhere, but two of us came out with a job. On weekends and some days after school I worked as a kitchen porter in this restaurant. I did this for about a year before getting a similar job in the pub next door. This one I held for two years, over which my role expanded to basically everything in the pub apart from serving alcohol, not yet being of age.

The owner of this pub had some financial constraints that led me to see, what I now know was some very illegal corner-cutting, and was perhaps a perfect example of how not to run a business.

This took me up to 2003. I'd been consistently employed in some capacity since I was 13, but the decision I made when I was 17 was to postpone going to university for a year. My plan for this gap year was to work for the first six months, save as much money as I could, and then spend the next six months travelling.

To this point in my life, I'd gone on a school trip to Berlin, had a couple of day-trips to Belgium and France, and a family holiday in Ireland. Other than that my life had been constrained to the UK, so I still saw the world as this big thing, ripe for exploring, and I couldn't in good conscience consign myself to another four years of education without getting out there and seeing it.

To start this gap year I did a course at my local swimming pool to become a lifeguard and immediately got employed full-time. The problem was that if you were not long ago earning £2.20 per day delivering newspapers, when you suddenly find yourself on a full-time salary, even if it's a close to minimum wage full-time salary, you suddenly feel very rich.

In this job I took every second of overtime I could get. If someone was sick or on holiday, it wasn't unheard of for me to work 90 hours in a week. The pool opened at 6am, I was there. It would close at 11pm and I was still there. When your job is to just stare at water all day, it's oddly therapeutic. Unlike phyiscal jobs, I was paid mostly to just sit there. I was already very accustomed to being short on sleep, so these 90 hour weeks weren't very physically demanding. Such long hours could be tough mentally, but then I saw my pay-cheque each month, and we'd go again.

It was during this year that I shook-off the teenage rebellious phase I'd been going through. I intentionally lost a tonne of weight that I'd gained in the years prior from eating junk food and playing video games. This was when I started running, and the obsession with exercise that I gained has remained ever since.

So I was now feeling fit and healthy, and how many 18 year olds do you know with thousands of pounds in their bank account? It was a hard sell to tell me that I should quit this job and go "travelling". Fuck off I want the money, so this gap year became me working full-time for the entire year, and I went to university as rich as just about any student, and from that point to this, I've never let my bank account slip to the point that I need to worry about money. Knowing how draining it was to earn it in the first place, I learned financial responsibility that still serves me well today.

I hadn't ultimately done any travelling on this gap year, but it had never left my mind. When I was applying to different universities, I had two criteria that I looked for. The first was that the university wasn't in London. I'd been born there, raised there, and spent my entire life there. Not only would being away give me some independence, but I'd get to see a bit more of the country. And it turns-out that not living in London was a pretty good financial decision too, although I'm not sure that factored-in too much.

The second criteria was I only looked at courses that included a year on exchange. I'd studied economics and business studies at A-level. I enjoyed it, and with my new-found appreciation for making money, it was the obvious choice for university. With the grades I had, I wanted the best university I could get into, not in London and offering a year abroad as part of its business course.

I ended up in Hull, then considered the worst city in England as many people insisted on telling me. While that may or may not have been true, it sure was cheap. Every night of the week you could find a bar selling £1 drinks; something unheard of today, and rent was far below posher nearby places like York and Leeds. That meant that for whatever else you want to say about it, and there is a lot you could say about it, Hull was an amazing place to be a student.

I joined the American football team, which further galvanised my push towards health and fitness (apart from all the drinking). And while I'd foregone the opportunity to travel during my gap year, I was determined to make the most of the long summer break after my first year. I applied for a working visa in Canada, and as soon as my exams were over, I went back to London and got on a plane to Vancouver.

## My first time travelling

This trip to Canada, in the summer of 2005 is what I consider my introduction to travelling as a whole. It was my first time out of Europe, but more importantly it was my first time going on a trip that I organised.

That might seem minor now that I've spent most of my adult life abroad, but at this time it felt like a big deal. Like I was getting out there, spreading my wings and exploring the world.

I had a working visa, so on arriving in Vancouver started pounding the pavements with my CV, handing it to anyone that would take it before ultimately getting a couple of part-time jobs, one collecting glasses in a bar and the other working for a waiting agency. This was in an age before the Internet was really a big thing. There was no applying for jobs online, there was no Airbnb. If you wanted a job, you had to apply in person with your CV, and if you wanted to find a place to live, you had to interact with an actual person. Ugh.

Being out in this new country, no one that I knew, having to fend for myself, it was truly an amazing time, and to this day Vancouver holds a special place in my heart, but alas it was only a summer vacation so I had to be back in England for the new academic year, but not before spreading my wings a bit further. When I'd bought my flights, my outbound flight went from London to Vancouver, but my return flight went from New York to London. And if you don't know North America, it's quite big, and Vancouver and New York are on opposite sides of it. I'd planned my trip this way so that I'd be forced to do some actual travelling, so after 10 weeks in Vancouver, I packed-up to start what I'd consider my first time backpacking.

I had six weeks to get to New York, and the first two of these I spent getting even further away. I went west to Vancouver Island, before taking a couple of ferries north until I was in Alaska. Nowadays, I think the mythical feel around Alaska has been dispelled somewhat, but at that time I was fascianated simply by the idea of it, and it didn't disappoint.

Being a dumb 19 year old I did pretty much everything in my power to get myself killed, like wandering up mountains in shorts and a t-shirt without a map or any equipment. I almost got my just desserts a couple of times in a day at one point, as firstly I fell through the snow at the top of a mountain, because it turns out snow melts from the bottom as well. Luckly I landed on my feet without injuring myself. And then I got lost and only just made it back by nightfall.

I somehow survived, and after taking a short flight from Juneau to Anchorage, decided that I was going to make the rest of my trip to New York by land. My logic was that you don't see anything by flying, and I wanted to get a feel for the whole country.

So from Anchorage it was an 18-hour bus over to Whitehorse back in Canada. From Whitehorse it was a 28-hour bus down to Edmonton. From Edmonton it was a 52-hour bus to Toronto, after which the rest of the trip to Montreal and ultimately to New York felt rather tame.

I boarded my flight in New York to mark the end of this trip, but that was it. By this point I'd caught the travel bug. I'd had such a great time, it was like a drug to me. By now I knew that travel was going to be a big part of my life.
