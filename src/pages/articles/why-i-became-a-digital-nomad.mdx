The Internet is littered with tales of one-time digital nomads who went onto regret their decision. I'm not one of those, I love my life and being a digital nomad has been the most consistent happiness I've known in my life.

With most of my adult life being spent backpacking, travelling, or living abroad in some capacity, I went into this with my eyes wide open and nothing has really surprised me, but it's definitely not a lifestyle to suit everyone.

Others may have different justification, but these are the reasons that being a digital nomad suits me.

## What is the meaning of life?

When I leave this world, I want it to be a better place because I was part of it. That's the overriding motivator for everything I do in my life.

I envision that one day, hopefully a long way into the future, I'm lying on my deathbed looking back at my life, powerless to go back and change anything, and in that moment I want to be happy with the way I have lived.

I'm sure that every person that accepts their mortality has a similar vision, and what one person views as success in their life may hold no influence over others. For some people money is how they measure success. For others it's power, or fame, or relationships, or inventiveness, or excitement, or adventure and none of those are wrong.

Until such time that we have plausible explanation for why we're here to begin with, there is no right or wrong way to live. For me though the measure of success I have chosen is I want the world to be a happier, kinder, more positive place because I was part of it. I want to know that more happiness exists because I was here, than if I had never been here at all. That is success and that is what motivates me, and in order to project positivity onto others, the first thing you need is to be a positive, happy person yourself. So the reason that I live like I do? Quite simply, this is a lifestyle that makes me happy.

Perhaps that was obvious from the beginning; after all, why would I live like this if it didn't make me happy? Yet I will meet people with regularity who tell me that I could make so much more money by living a different way, or changing certain things, which is certainly true, but unlike them, money has never been my primary motivator. It is only important to the extent I need it to comfortably survive, but once I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a little bit more to bring solace to my lifestyle, then it becomes worthless. At that point I will never sacrifice happiness for wealth.

I have found more happiness from this lifestyle than any other way I've lived, but why? What is it about being a digital nomad that makes me happy?

## Routine check-up

You know something I really like in my life? Having a routine. And you know something I really hate? Having a routine.

If I have no daily routine, for example when I arrive somewhere new, then whatever I do on that first day, I'm likely to do on the second day, the third day, and every day after that as well. I'm a creature of habit, and find comfort doing things with regularity.

Yet the more time I spend following in the same footsteps as the day before, the more I start to care about the intricate details of it to the point that the most insignificant deviation can ruin my mood.

For example, back when I lived in Bangkok I used to work six days per week. Every day I'd take the subway two stops to the school that I worked at, and because I did this exact same route almost daily for three years, every tiny detail of it was locked-into my mind.

I went back to Bangkok in 2022, four years after I'd left, and for sentimental reasons I decided to walk down the street I used to live on. It was only then I realised quite how intricately I knew the fifteen-minute walk to the subway station, because four years later I could point-out which paving stones had moved, where there was a new pot-hole or one that had been filled, things like that.

After three years of taking the same route to work everyday, I was so set in my ways that I always stood on the exact same place on the platform while I waited for the train. It was simultaneously the best set of doors for me to get off at to take the smallest number of steps to get to my work, while also being right beneath an air conditioner which was always pleasant after walking there in the Bangkok heat.

I would start work in the late afternoon, a quiet time on the trains, and I'd board at a fairly quiet station, so I'd often have the platform to myself. Once in a blue moon though, every few months, I'd come down onto the platform and someone would be stood in my spot, waiting for the train. And while common sense would tell you that's a completely insignificant thing to happen, it's a public platform and there are many, many other places you can stand, when you're so locked-into doing the same routine day after day, it would bother me.

When you get to that point by having the same routine for too long, then it becomes a horrible thing. A huge stressor on your life, and in my experience the only way to break it is to take a holiday, to take a step back, to get away for a while, and to start again from scratch.

For a short time a routine is comforting and necessary tool to live well, but over a longer period it becomes a poison. When you don't have a routine, for example if you're backpacking, you long for one. I remember backpacking and dreaming about having a nice, steady job, rather than a constant shift of moving from hostel to hostel. Yet how many people in their nice, steady jobs spend their day dreaming about taking a vacation? I know I sure did at times I've been settled.

This was the primary reason that I sought that the digital nomad lifestyle would be right for me, and why now living it, I still think it's right for me. It gives me the perfect balance of routine.

While extenal factors, primarily visas, can dictate how long I stay in each place I go, typically I'll stay in each place for roughly a month.

In a month I am settled enough that I can build a routine and have comfort in my day, yet right when I start to get obsessive about my routine, I leave, go somewhere new, and start again.

This lifestyle has a built-in safeguard that doesn't allow your world to become too small. Forget about the travel, or the socialising, or the cultural experiences, or any of that wank that people proclaim motivates them to live like this. For me the number one benefit is I'm at my happiest when I get to move location with moderate regularity, but not so much that I feel like a constant tourist.

## Work in progress

In much the same way that keeping the same daily routine for too long leads to a level of relative insanity, working too hard, especially in the same job, can be equally damaging.

While happiness may me my overriding goal, a lot goes into trying to be a happy person, and perhaps the most imporant factor is your health. If you're not physically and mentally healthy it's hard to live with a smile on your face, and human beings weren't designed to 'work' for forty hours per week. Estimates differ, but the hunter-gatherers that took responsibility for a large part of our evolution used to 'work' about fifteen hours per week. Fifteen hours hunting/gathering. That's roughly what we evolved to do.

I don't know where the idea of a forty-hour work week came from, but I have never held a full-time job and been happy or content. Even in the better jobs, my employment has always been accompanied by a level of misery, where I'm being worn-down mentally and I'm too exhausted to take care of myself physically.

I count my blessings that I was born where I was, not because I hold any pride in being British or have a patriotic bone in my body at all. No, my thanks is simply that we're one of the richer countries on earth, which means we also have high salaries compared to much of the world. And while living in London might require me to work five days per week to be comfortable, I can take that same wage to some cheaper countries and be comfortable working two days per week, so that's what I do.

If you look where I go as a digital nomad, it is not North America, it is not Japan or Korea, it is not Australia, and it is not north or western Europe. Why? Why would I go to an expensive country when I can get an equal or better quality of life for a fraction of the cost elsewhere?

I have a five-day weekend every week, and being a digital nomad is what enables that.

When I graduated university and started backpacking when I was 23, my primary motivation was 'I don't want to spend my entire life sitting in an office.' That was at a time before remote working was really a thing, but even with the addition of remote work fifteen years later, I still feel the exact same way. I just don't really think that a person can be happy while working forty hours per week. No matter what your job is, your mind needs variety.
