This is the (very long) story of the series of events that led to me choosing that the digital nomad lifestyle was right for me. [Skip to the bottom](#) TODO for the ultimate deciding factors.

## What led me to start travelling?

I guess that everything that's happened in my life and every decision I've ever made has led me to where I am today, but I want to start in 2003. I was a 17 year old rebellious teenage doing pretty much everything in my power to ensure I failed my A-level exams and didn't get the grades I needed to go to university. Luckily I'd accumulated enough knowledge before reaching that phase to pull me through my exams anyway, but I was now far from the straight-A student that I had been before grades mattered.

Even at this age I paid little mind to the customary way of doing things, and while the usual step was to go to go from here to university, I'd spent every bit of my life that I could remember to this point, in education, and the thought of immediately signing-up to four more years kind of sickened me.

Even as a child I'd wanted power over my own finances. Then until now, I hate having any reliance on others, so I'd got my first job as soon as it was legal. That was a paper-round when I was 13. At 6am every morning, before school, I'd pull myself out of bed, cycle to the nearby newsagent, and for £2.20 per day would deliver the daily newspapers to various properties.

Contrary to how I am today when the earlier I get to bed the better, at 13 I stayed up pretty late every night, so getting up at 6am every morning, I spent most of my life exhausted, and the decline in my school grades testified to this, although I kind of lost all interest around now anyway, so maybe the tiredness masked an overall lack of motivation.

After a year or so I got tired of being constantly tired so moved-onto delivering the local free newspaper. That might look like an easy job when you see people doing it, but unlike in my previous round where there were just a few stops, these free newspapers have to go to _every_ house and I had three different rounds. It would take several hours every week, but the money was pretty good. For a 14 year old.

A new restaurant opened-up around the corner from where I lived, and when me and a few friends were walking past once day, we noticed a sign advertising for help in the kitchen. Looking back, having this mob of teenagers come in it's amazing we got anywhere, but two of us came out with a job. On weekends and some days after school I worked as a kitchen porter in this restaurant. I stayed there for about a year before getting a similar job in the pub next door. I had this last job for two years, over which my role expanded to basically everything in the pub apart from serving alcohol, not yet being of age.

The owner of this pub had some financial constraints that led me to see, what I now know was some very illegal corner-cutting, and was perhaps a perfect example of how not to manage a business.

This took me up to 2003. I'd been consistently employed in some capacity since I was 13, but the decision I made when I was 17 was to postpone going to university for a year. My plan for this gap year was to work for the first six months, save as much money as I could, and then spend the next six months travelling.

To this point in my life, I'd gone on a school trip to Berlin, had a couple of day-trips to Belgium and France, and a family holiday in Ireland. Other than that my life had been constrained to the UK, so I still saw the world as this big thing, ripe for exploring, and I couldn't in good conscience consign myself to another four years of education without getting out there and seeing it.

At this point I did a course at my local swimming pool to become a lifeguard and immediately got employed full-time. The problem was that if you were not long ago earning £2.20 per day delivering newspapers, when you suddenly find yourself on a full-time salary, even if it's a close to minimum wage salary, you suddenly feel very rich.

In this job I took every second of overtime I could get. If someone was sick or on holiday, it wasn't unheard of for me to work 90 hours in a week. The pool opened at 6am, I was there. It would close at 11pm and I was still there. When your job is to just stare at water all day, it's oddly therapeutic. Unlike phyiscal jobs, I was paid mostly to just sit there. I was already very accustomed to being short on sleep, so these 90 hour weeks weren't very physically demanding. Such long hours could be tough mentally, but then I saw my pay-cheque each month, and we'd go again.

It was during this year that I shook-off the teenage rebellious phase I'd been going through. I intentionally lost a tonne of weight that I'd gained in the years prior by eating junk food and playing video games. This was when I started running, and the obsession with exercise that I gained has remained ever since.

So I was now feeling fit and healthy, and how many 18 year olds do you know with thousands of pounds in their bank account? It was a hard sell to tell me that I should quit this job and go "travelling". Fuck off, I want the money, so this gap year became me working full-time for the entire year, and I went to university as rich as just about any student, and from that point to this, I've never let my bank account slip to the point that I need to worry. Knowing how draining it was to earn all this money, I learned the financial responsibility that still serves me well today.

I hadn't done any travelling on this gap year, but it had never left my mind. When I was applying to different universities, I had two criteria that I looked for. The first was that it wasn't in London. I'd been born there, raised there, and spent my entire life there. Not only would being away give me some independence, but I'd get to see a bit more of the country. And it turns-out that not living in London was a pretty good financial decision too, although I'm not sure that factored-in too much.

The second criteria was I only looked at courses that included a year on exchange. I'd studied economics and business studies at A-level. I enjoyed it, and with my new-found appreciation for making money, it was the obvious choice for university. With the grades I had, I wanted the best university I could get into, not in London and offering a year abroad as part of the course.

I ended up in Hull, then considered the worst city in England as many people insisted on telling me. While that may or may not have been true, it sure was cheap. Every night of the week you could find a bar selling £1 drinks; something unheard of today, and rent was far below posher places nearby like York and Leeds. All that meant that, for whatever else you want to say about it, and there is a lot you could say about it, Hull was an amazing place to be a student.

I joined the American football team, which further galvanised my push towards health and fitness (apart from all the drinking). And while I'd foregone the opportunity to travel during my gap year, I was determined to make the most of the long summer break after my first year. I applied for a working visa in Canada, and as soon as my exams were over, I went back to London and caught a plane to Vancouver.
