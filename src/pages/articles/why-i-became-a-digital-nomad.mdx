The Internet is littered with tales of one-time digital nomads who went onto regret their decision. I am not one of those, I love my lifestyle and being a digital nomad has been the era of the most consistent happiness that I've known in my life.

With most of my adult life being spent backpacking, travelling, or living abroad in some capacity, I went into this with my eyes wide open and nothing has really surprised me, but it's definitely not a lifestyle to suit everyone.

Others may have different justification, but these are the reasons that this lifestyle suits me.

## What is the meaning of life?

When I leave this world, I want it to be a better place because I was part of it. That's the overriding motivator for every decision that I make in life.

I envision that one day, hopefully a way into the future, I'm lying on my deathbed looking back at my life, powerless to go back and change anything. And in that moment, I want to be happy with the way I have lived.

I'm sure that every person that accepts that mortality has similar visions, and what one person views as success in their life may hold no influence over someone else.

For some people money is how they measure success. For others it's power, or fame, or relationships, or inventiveness, or excitement, or adventure and none of those are wrong.

Until such time that we have plausible explanation for why we're here to begin with, there is no right or wrong way to live. For me though, what I have chosen as the measure of success in my life, is I want the world to be a happier, kinder, more positive place because I was part of it. I want to know that more happiness exists because I was here, than if I had never been here at all. That is success and that is what motivates me to live how I do.

And in order to project positivity onto others, the first thing you need is to be a positive, happy person yourself. So the reason that I live like I do? Quite simply, this is a lifestyle that makes me happy.

Perhaps that was obvious from the beginning; after all, why would I live like this if it didn't make me happy? Yet I will meet people with regularity who tell me that I could make so much more money by living this way, or changing that, which is very true, but unlike them, money has never been my primary motivator. It is only important to me to the extent I need it to comfortably survive, but once I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a little bit more to bring solace to my lifestyle, then it becomes worthless. At that point I will never sacrifice happiness for wealth.

I have found more happiness from this lifestyle than any other way I've lived, but why? What is it about being a digital nomad that makes me happy?
