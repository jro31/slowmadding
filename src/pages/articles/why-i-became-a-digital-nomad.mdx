The Internet is littered with tales of one-time digital nomads who went onto regret their decision. I am not one of those, I love my lifestyle and being a digital nomad has been the era of the most consistent happiness that I've known in my life.

With most of my adult life being spent backpacking, travelling, or living abroad in some capacity, I went into this with my eyes wide open and nothing has really surprised me, but it's definitely not a lifestyle to suit everyone.

Others may have different justification, but these are the reasons that this lifestyle suits me.

## What is the meaning of life?

When I leave this world, I want it to be a better place because I was part of it. That's the overriding motivator for every decision that I make in life.

I envision that one day, hopefully a way into the future, I'm lying on my deathbed looking back at my life, powerless to go back and change anything. And in that moment, I want to be happy with the way I have lived.

I'm sure that every person that accepts that mortality has similar visions, and what one person views as success in their life may hold no influence over someone else.

For some people money is how they measure success. For others it's power, or fame, or relationships, or inventiveness, or excitement, or adventure and none of those are wrong.

Until such time that we have plausible explanation for why we're here to begin with, there is no right or wrong way to live. For me though, what I have chosen as the measure of success in my life, is I want the world to be a happier, kinder, more positive place because I was part of it. I want to know that more happiness exists because I was here, than if I had never been here at all. That is success and that is what motivates me to live how I do.

And in order to project positivity onto others, the first thing you need is to be a positive, happy person yourself. So the reason that I live like I do? Quite simply, this is a lifestyle that makes me happy.

Perhaps that was obvious from the beginning; after all, why would I live like this if it didn't make me happy? Yet I will meet people with regularity who tell me that I could make so much more money by living this way, or changing that, which is very true, but unlike them, money has never been my primary motivator. It is only important to me to the extent I need it to comfortably survive, but once I have a roof over my head, food in my belly, and a little bit more to bring solace to my lifestyle, then it becomes worthless. At that point I will never sacrifice happiness for wealth.

I have found more happiness from this lifestyle than any other way I've lived, but why? What is it about being a digital nomad that makes me happy?

## Routine check-up

You know something I really like in my life? Having a routine. And you know something I really hate? Having a routine.

If I have no daily routine, for example if I arrive somewhere new, then whatever I do on that first day, I'm likely to do on the second day, the third day, and every day after that as well. I'm a creature of habit, and find comfort doing things with regularity.

Yet the more time I spend following the regime, the more I start to care about the intricate details of it to the point that the tiniest and most insignificant deviation can completely upset my mood.

For example, back when I lived in Bangkok I used to work six days per week. Every day I'd take the subway two stops to the school that I worked at, and because I did this exact same route almost daily for three years, every tiny detail was locked-into my mind.

I went back to Bangkok in 2022, four years after I left, and for sentimental value decided to walk down the street I used to live on. It was only then I realised quite how intricately I knew the fifteen-minute walk to the subway station, because four years later I could point-out which paving stones had moved, where there was a new pot-hole or one that had been filled, things like that.

After three years of taking the same route to work everyday, I was so set in my ways that I always stood in the exact same place on the platform while I waited for the train. It was simultaneously the best set of doors for me to get off at to take the smallest number of steps to get to my work, while also being right beneath an air conditioner, which was always pleasant after walking there in the Bangkok heat.

I would start work in the late afternoon, a quiet time on the trains, and I'd board at a fairly quiet station, so I'd often have the platform to myself. Once in a blue moon though, every few months, I'd come down onto the platform and someone would be stood in my spot, waiting for the train. And while common sense would tell you that's a completely insignificant thing to happen, it's a public platform and there are many, many other places you can stand, when you're so locked-into doing the same routine day after day, it can ruin your mood.

When you get to that point, and you get to that point by having the same routine for too long, then it becomes a horrible things. A huge stressor on your life. And in my experience, the only way to break it is to take a holiday, to take a step back, to get away for a while, and to start again from scratch.

For a short time a routine is comforting and a necessary tool to live well, but over a longer period it becomes a poison. When you don't have a routine, for example if you're backpacking, you long for one. I remember backpacking and dreaming about having a nice, steady job, rather than a constant shift of moving from hostel to hostel. Yet how many people in their nice, steady jobs spend their day dreaming about taking a vacation? I know I sure did at time I've been settled.

This was the primary reason that I sought that the digital nomad lifestyle would be right for me, and why now living it, I still think it's right for me. It gives me the perfect balance of routine.

While extenal factors, primarily visas, can dictate how long I stay in each place I go, typically I'll stay for roughly a month, because that is the perfect amount for me.

In a month I am settled enough that I can build a routine and have comfort in my day, yet right when I start to get obsessive about my routine, I leave, go somewhere new, and start again.

This lifestyle has a built-in safeguard to not allow your world to become too small. Forget about the travel, or the socialising, or the cultural experiences or any of that wank that people like to proclaim motivates them to live like this. For me, the number one benefit is I'm at my happiest when I get to move location with moderate regularity, but not so much that I feel like a constant tourist.
