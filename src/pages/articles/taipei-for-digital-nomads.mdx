Unfortunately the apartment is in the middle of a horseshoe, with residential apartments and businesses flanking it on both sides, meaning that in the absence of any drapes or translucent curtains, if you leave the blinds open, people in adjacent rooms can see in (particularly when you're lying in bed), but if you close them no light gets in. The best middle-ground I found was to entirely close the left blind while sleeping, and to half-close the right one. It didn't give me total privacy, but it did at least stop the apartment immediately to the left being able to see in from about a metre away, which would be weird while sleeping, and it let in enough light that I at least rose with daylight.",

Here you pay more for a tiny room than you do for a large apartment in either of those, but it at least has all the essentials. As there's only one surface in the apartment, the desk serves as both a workstation and a kitchen surface. On top of the microwave it an electric hob that you can bring down to the desk for cooking, and in the cabinet under the desk are a couple of pans. A limited amount of utensils and crockery are provided, although I think they just threw-in whatever they had lying around because it includes two dinner knives, but no forks. Luckily I'm a seasoned nomad and carry a lot of my own kitchenware to overcome the shortcomings of my hosts.",

## Where to run in Taipei

### Da'an Park

When you come to Taipei and ask people the best places to run, their first answer will invariably be <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiY7vbmaHAbbwqdMA'>Da'an Park</ExternalLink>.

Don't listen to them, it's shit.

It's a decent-sized park in the city centre with a roughly 2.2km circumference, and even better it includes a jogging track. Unfortunately, despite having almost an entire park of not jogging track to go on, people not jogging feel the need to not jog on the jogging track, so this narrow track will be populated with walkers, senile old people, groups of people, people in wheelchairs etc, much impairing your ability to jog on the jogging track.

Furthermore, if I ever encounter the person that designed Da'an Park, then I hope I'm carrying a mirror, because they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. The jogging track goes around the outside of the park, but only three quarters of it. At the north end of the park it ceases existing, leaving you to navigate this part of the park on the paths, and Da'an Park is a very popular tourist spot, particularly with old people, and you know how slow and immobile they are. Making your way through the sea of wrinkles you're at times forced to slow to little more than a walk.

The best example I can give of how shit Da'an Park is for running, is if you ever come here you'll notice that far more people run on the pavement outside the park, than actually run in it. That is for a good reason.

### National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground

The <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vRTSQVCrP6U32Ha39'>National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground</ExternalLink>, as Google Translate tells me it's called (國立臺北科技大學運動場 in Chinese) is a 200m running track, open 24 hours per day on the National Taipei University of Technology campus obviously. This was where I did the majority of my running in Taipei.

For my first run here I did a steady 5k, which is 25 laps and is just depressing, going around and around and around and around. Luckily I was in terrible shape and in an attempt to recity this started doing guided HIIT runs and interval runs instead, and for this kind of run having a track, even just a 200m one, is perfect.

I don't think at any point I had to share the track with more than four other people, no matter what time of day I came, and being a small track on a university campus, it's pretty safe so you can bring a bag and leave it unattatended with little worry it'll get nicked, and there are toilets in the surrounding university buildings. Once I'd moved to my second room and coming here was a YouBike trip away, these luxuries were welcome.

It's basic and it's no thrills, but it does the job.
