Hummus is also sold separately (NT$80/NT$115/NT$165) and everything on the menu can be taken away, so when I came here I'd usually get an additional pot to cook with my famous hummus pasta with.

Three things that annoyed me about Taipei - Crossing the road, the elderly, urinals, trash in YouBike baskets, dogs in buggies

TODO: Add any photos that don't fit elsewhere

## Getting into Taipei

Taiwan offers nationals from many countries including the USA and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and many European countries (including the UK, Germany and France) a 90-day visa exemption. One of the requirements to get this exemption is an outbound air/sea ticket, but as I found, it's not strictly enforced.

Airlines get fined when they bring passengers who're denied entry, so if you're travelling to a country that requires an outbound ticket without one, you're much more likely to have issues boarding the plane to get there than you are at immigration.

When I flew to Taiwan I was yet to decide how long I'd stay so I didn't have an outbound ticket. I've done this before for countless other destinations and it's never been an issue, but on this occasion, the airline staffer checking me in asked me _"Do you have an outbound flight?"_

_"No,"_ I responded, _"I haven't decided when I'm going to leave yet."_

As I said this, it was fully of the expectation that he was going to tell me I needed to buy one before checking-in. Instead though, he thought for a second before asking _"do you want a seat with extra legroom?"_

So that's how seriously they take the outbound travel requirement. Instead of stopping me boarding I got upgraded for free, and when I went through immigration in Taiwan I was asked no questions at all, about outbound travel or anything else. They just took my passport and stamped me in.

This was at Taoyuan Airport which, despite being outside of Taipei, is the the main airport that serves Taipei. It is connected to Taipei by an MRT line that gets you to Taipei Main Station in about 35 minutes.

## Is Taipei safe?

I don't even know if crime exists in Taipei. I'm usually very paranoid about the security of my possessions, but in Taipei I found myself getting very complacent because it's such a safe place.

In a city of 2.7 million people, it's mad to me that I would go out cycling with local people, and we'd just leave our bikes at the side of the road to go wandering around for a couple of hours, and I was the only person who feared they wouldn't be there when we returned. They always were.

It's a city where you can leave your wallet on the table while you go to the toilet, and it'll still be there when you get back. In that sense, I've never been to a place this safe before.

There are two safety concerns that hang-over Taipei, neither of which should worry you or stop you coming here.

The first is that China makes endless overtures about invasion. It'll probably never happen, but if it does you might want to consider not being here.

The second is is earthquakes...

<ImageGallery images={safetyImages} />

## Will I die from an earthquake in Taipei?

Probably.

One morning, shortly after arriving in Taiwan, I was brushing my teeth when the room started shaking. _"Well this is weird,"_ I thought to myself, although it did make brushing my teeth easier.

Apart from a couple of almost unnoticeable tremors, I'd never experienced an earthquake before, but I'd timed it to be in Taiwan for the biggest one in 25 years. It left me a little shaken.

The Taiwan <ExternalLink url='https://www.cwa.gov.tw/V8/E/E/index.html'>Central Weather Administration</ExternalLink> reports all earthquakes, and from that point forth for the duration of my stay it reported regular aftershocks in Hualien - the site of the initial quake. Most of these were imperceptible in Taipei, but with ever-decreasing regularity through the duration of my stay, my room would just shake for a few seconds. By the end of my time here it had just become normal.

Taiwan's is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, but as such is one of the countries most prepared for them, employing very strict building codes. So if you are going to get caught in an earthquake, this is one of the best places to do it.

## Getting a SIM card in Taipei

I always ignore airport vendors selling SIM cards when I arrive somewhere new. It can make finding my room a bit of a pain if I haven't got a network, but airport vendors invariably sell tourist SIMs, where as I like to get myself on a local tariff with a SIM that will still be active if I ever come back to the country again, which you have to buy from elsewhere.

That is what I did when arriving in Taipei, instead going to a 'Chunghwa' store after checking-into my room and getting food (Chunghwa is the biggest network operator in Taiwan, with Taiwan Mobile and FarEasTone being the other main ones). I asked to get a local SIM rather than a tourist SIM, but they declined, citing that as I was in Taiwan as a tourist I was only permitted to buy a tourist SIM.

Well fuck me then I guess.

Whether you can shop around in order to find a shop to skirt this rule I'm not sure. I couldn't be arsed so I just bought a tourist SIM. Therefore the only advantage I had of buying a SIM here rather than at the airport, is at the airport they only advertised tourist SIMs up to 30 days in length, where as here I could buy one up to 180 days.

The good news about these tourist SIMs is that they provide unlimited data that is truly unlimited. With no speed throttling no matter how much data you use, you can watch all the Pornhub you want. The bad news is that these plans are only available with 4G. 5G tourist SIMs are only available for up to 7 days, but for normal needs, 4G is fine. You'll have no speed issues for normal, everyday use, including tethering your laptop in order to make video calls.

The other bad news is that these SIMs cannot be topped-up and the plans cannot be extended. If you buy a SIM for 30 days, then after 30 days you need to go back to the store and buy another SIM with a different phone number. Given this limitation (and how long it took the woman in the Chunghwa store to fill-in my details on the computer), I opted to buy a 90 day SIM, even though my loose plans at the time only had me staying in Taiwan for sixty.

With a 30 day plan costing NT$1,000 and a 90 day plan costing NT$2,199, I decided it was worth paying extra just to save having to sign-up again, and I'm glad I did because I decided to stay for beyond 60 days anyway. No 60 day plan is offered.

I have a general hatred of rules that assume I can see into the future, because the whole point of being a digital nomad is you have the freedom to change your mind at a moment's notice, which is why getting onto a local tariff is always worth the hassle of getting from the airport without any data. Unfortunately that's not how it works in Taiwan.

Taiwan's existence as an independent country is predicated on the US having the strength and resolve to deter a hostile Chinese takeover. Our fearless Chinese leader wanders around with that big-dick energy of an inherent right to rule over all people of Chinese descent. And while that energy might not translate to reality now, as US power wanes and China's strenghens, it's only a matter of time for the right cirucumstances to present themselves.

The goal of any good dictator is to retain and strengthen power at all costs, aspirations which seldom conjoin with freedom and quality of life for the people. Such events in Taiwan could be akin to The Taliban returning to power in Afghanistan.

Whether this reality plays-out in a year, in a hundred, or never at all no one knows, but if it does then gone will be the lifestyle that makes Taiwan such an amazing place to be. So to play it safe I'd suggest that should you desire to come here at all, then make it sooner rather than later.

## Running in Taipei

Taipei has big, wide pavements, traffic is minimal for a large Asian city, and the air quality is comparably good. So I know what you're thinking: Taipei must be a great city to go running in.

Yeah, not so fast.

While being in a city where the rule of law is followed almost to the letter is mostly a positive, the place where I really found it annoying was crossing the road. Even at tiny crossings where you can clearly see that there are no cars anywhere in the vacinity, people stand there and wait for the green man. At bigger crossings this can take a couple of minutes, so when you go anywhere on foot or by bike in Taipei, however long you think it's going to take, add on 25% for waiting to cross the street.

That's an annoyance on foot, but it downright ruins a perfectly good run, so unless you're willing to have a very stop-start run (I'm not), then I'd describe Taipei's streets as unsuitable for running. Thankfully you have some alternatives.

I only ran in [two] places in Taipei - [Da'an Park and the National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground], as I'll detail below, but Taipei is littered with viable alternatives, with the caveat that you must be comfortable going around and around in circles.

There are many running tracks dotted around the city, including on university campuses, so get onto Google maps and either by searching or looking at satellite view, you'll be able to find one pretty nearby to where you're staying.

For example though, there's a public running track on the grounds of the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZCX6j1c6f18mqFFw9'>Taipei Arena</ExternalLink>. I didn't run there myself, but I walked past it and it appeared free and open to the public. Or you could try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/jvkRjXzb42ZmehrA6'>Minquan Sports Park</ExternalLink> in the north of the city, or <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WWvK8UrzMCSeXe5o8'>Fukuwa Sports Park</ExternalLink> just over the river in New Taipei City, or the sports field at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/EU3kGExih4wgpto76'>National Taiwan Normal University</ExternalLink>, as well as several parks dedicated to sport such as <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftGcTddwfFSoRjQb8'>Wenshan Jingmei Sports Park</ExternalLink> or the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/hV1Q9JiH52D2shuP6'>Erchong Floodway Sports Park</ExternalLink>.

In the unlikely event that you can't find something close to you, then because of the big, wide pavements in Taipei, just running around the block that you're staying in may be a possibility.

All of this is great if you don't mind running around in circles. For shorter runs and guided runs or runs when you're listening to an audiobook or a podcast, it can be nice to be running around a flat track where you don't really have to think about where you're going or where you're stepping. Doing that for long, slow runs will drive you crazy though, so if you want to actually run somewhere without having to stop to cross the road every two minutes, then the only place I went in Taipei that's viable is along the riverside.

Used more commonly by cyclists than runners (although you will see the occasional runner as well), the banks of both the Keelung River and the Tamsui River have concrete paths running along them, and are void of vehicles. I don't know how far these paths go, but through my time in Taipei I cycled along them for hours and never reached the end, so for running you can really go any distance you want. As an example, you could go from <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6ZeQnsouG1hTFkok7'>Guanshan Riverside Park to Tamsui MRT</ExternalLink>, a distance of 24.7km, running almost exclusively along the riverside. Tamsui MRT is on the red line, so you could get on a train and come straight back into town, or if that run isn't long enough for you, you could turn around and run back again, perhaps on the other side of the river, or along the Tamsui River instead of going back along the Keelung River.

So while the frustration of spending half your life waiting to cross the road initially makes Taipei feel like a city that's not so friendly to runners, once you've explored a bit you'll realise you have many options.

<ImageGallery images={runningImages} />

### Da'an Park

When you come to Taipei and ask people the best places to run, their first answer will invariably be <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiY7vbmaHAbbwqdMA'>Da'an Park</ExternalLink>.

Don't listen to them, it's shit.

It's a decent-sized park in the city centre with a roughly 2.2km circumference, and even better it includes a jogging track. Unfortunately, despite having almost an entire park of not jogging track to go on, people not jogging feel the need to not jog on the jogging track, so this narrow track will be populated with walkers, senile old people, groups of people, people in wheelchairs etc, much impairing your ability to jog on the jogging track.

Furthermore, if I ever encounter the person that designed Da'an Park, then I hope I'm carrying a mirror because they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. The jogging track goes around the outside of the park, but only three quarters of it. At the north end of the park it ceases existing, leaving you to navigate this part of the park on the paths, and Da'an Park is a very popular tourist spot, particularly with old people, and you know how slow and immobile they are. Making your way through the sea of wrinkles you're at times forced to slow to little more than a walk.

The best example I can give of how shit Da'an Park is for running, is if you ever come here you'll notice that far more people run on the pavement outside the park, than actually run in it. That is for a good reason.

<ImageGallery images={daanParkImages} />

### National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground

The <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vRTSQVCrP6U32Ha39'>National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground</ExternalLink>, as Google Translate tells me it's called (ÂúãÁ´ãËá∫ÂåóÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠∏ÈÅãÂãïÂ†¥ in Chinese) is a 200m running track, open 24 hours per day on the National Taipei University of Technology campus obviously. This was where I did the majority of my running in Taipei.

For my first run here I did a steady 5k, which is 25 laps and is just depressing, going around and around and around and around. Luckily I was in terrible shape and in an attempt to recity this started doing guided HIIT runs and interval runs instead, and for this kind of run having a track, even just a 200m one, is perfect.

I don't think at any point I had to share the track with more than four other people, no matter what time of day I came, and being a small track on a university campus, it's pretty safe so you can bring a bag and leave it unattatended with little worry it'll get nicked, and there are toilets in the surrounding university buildings. Once I'd moved to my second room and coming here was a YouBike trip away, these luxuries were even more welcome.

It's basic and it's no thrills, but it does the job.

### 5 mins to MRT Zhongxiao Xinsheng, studio for 2

<MapLink name='No.5, Section 1, Bade Rd' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/XJjTHcqTkYo5eg2y8' />

<AccommodationTable details={zhongzhengApartmentDetails} />

At the time I stayed here, this apartment near Zhongxiao Xinsheng MRT was the second most expensive place I'd stayed as a digital nomad, so you might think it's rather lavish.

Nah, accommodation in Taipei is just expensive. It's tiny, but it does have all essentials and I loved the location.

The number one thing I look for when choosing accommodation is that it gets a lot of daylight. Nothing puts me on the path to depression quicker than waking up in a dingy room, and with its big windows I thought this room would be sufficient. And it is, with one caveat.

The room is in the centre of a horseshoe of rooms. With the bed right next to the window, if you leave the blackout blinds open, people in the adjacent rooms can look in and watch you sleep, so staying here is a bit of a battle between leaving the blinds open enough that daylight gets in, but not so much that you wake up with people looking at you. Closing the left blind completely and half-closing the right one was the best I found, but even then people in some of the higher rooms can still look down at you in bed.

That aside, I'd say that this room has everything that you need... but only just. For example, there isn't a kitchen but there is a plug-in hob and a pan that you can use on the desk. That desk is the only surface in the apartment, so you have a workstation and you have a kitchen, just not at the same time.

There's only one sink in the apartment too. It's a bit weird brushing your teeth next to a draining rack with a dish-cloth in the sink. You do have a bathroom sink and a kitchen sink, but again, just not at the same time. These aren't issues unless you want them to be, because if you're here alone it's unlikely you're going to be brushing your teeth while doing the washing up, but it is something to be aware of.

And while it is a compact room, by laying my mat diagonally I did find I had space to exercise while playing my workouts on the TV. The sofa's comfortable enough as an alternative workstation, and I had absolutely no issues with the wifi throughout my stay. The buttons on the space-age washing machine are all labelled in Chinese and Google Translate is only so helpful. Doing your laundry is a little bit of pot-luck, but my clothes always came out cleaner than when I put them in, which is all you can really ask for.

If you search on Airbnb, you will find bigger rooms for cheaper. One thing you're paying for to stay here is the great location, and it is a great location. Zhongxiao Xinsheng MRT station is a short walk away. That's on the blue line just two stops from Taipei Main Station, so everything in Taipei is within easy access, but most things you need are actually walking distance.

The street that the apartment's on, including the building that it's in, is almost solely electronics shops, so if you like tech you'll be living your wet dream. There are loads of little eateries nearby, including the vegetarian branch of Mayur Indian Kitchen if you want vegan/vegetarian food, as well as a Carrefour supermarket. It's very close to the National Taipei University of Technology, making it a studenty area, but more importantly being walking distance to the university's running track. Da'an Park is a slightly longer walk (or a short YouBike ride) but still easily accessible on foot.

I at no point felt I was living a life of luxury when I stayed here. For the price I perhaps should have. But it had everything I needed so I was comfortable for my month here.
