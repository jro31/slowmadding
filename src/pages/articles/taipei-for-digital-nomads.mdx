The best middle-ground I found was to entirely close the left blind while sleeping, and to half-close the right one. It didn't give me total privacy, but it did at least stop the apartment immediately to the left being able to see in from about a metre away, which would be weird while sleeping, and it let in enough light that I at least rose with daylight.",

As there's only one surface in the apartment, the desk serves as both a workstation and a kitchen surface. On top of the microwave it an electric hob that you can bring down to the desk for cooking, and in the cabinet under the desk are a couple of pans. A limited amount of utensils and crockery are provided, although I think they just threw-in whatever they had lying around because it includes two dinner knives, but no forks.

## Getting a SIM card in Taipei

I always ignore airport vendors selling SIM cards when I arrive somewhere new. It can make finding my room a bit of a pain if I haven't got a network, but airport vendors invariably sell tourist SIMs, where as I like to get myself on a local tariff with a SIM that will still be active if I ever come back to the country again, which you have to buy from elsewhere.

That is what I did when arriving in Taipei, instead going to a 'Chunghwa' store after checking-into my room and getting food (Chunghwa is the biggest network operator in Taiwan, with Taiwan Mobile and FarEasTone being the other main ones). I asked to get a local SIM rather than a tourist SIM, but they declined, citing that as I was in Taiwan as a tourist I was only permitted to buy a tourist SIM.

Well fuck me then I guess.

Whether you can shop around in order to find a shop to skirt this rule I'm not sure. I couldn't be arsed so I just bought a tourist SIM. Therefore the only advantage I had of buying a SIM here rather than at the airport, is at the airport they only advertised tourist SIMs up to 30 days in length, where as here I could buy one up to 180 days.

The good news about these tourist SIMs is that they provide unlimited data that is truly unlimited. With no speed throttling no matter how much data you use, you can watch all the Pornhub you want. The bad news is that these plans are only available with 4G. 5G tourist SIMs are only available for up to 7 days, but for normal needs, 4G is fine. You'll have no speed issues for normal, everyday use, including tethering your laptop in order to make video calls.

The other bad news is that these SIMs cannot be topped-up and the plans cannot be extended. If you buy a SIM for 30 days, then after 30 days you need to go back to the store and buy another SIM with a different phone number. Given this limitation (and how long it took the woman in the Chunghwa store to fill-in my details on the computer), I opted to buy a 90 day SIM, even though my loose plans at the time only had me staying in Taiwan for sixty.

With a 30 day plan costing NT$1,000 and a 90 day plan costing NT$2,199, I decided it was worth paying extra just to save having to sign-up again, and I'm glad I did because I decided to stay for beyond 60 days anyway. No 60 day plan is offered.

I have a general hatred of rules that assume I can see into the future, because the whole point of being a digital nomad is you have the freedom to change your mind at a moment's notice, which is why getting onto a local tariff is always worth the hassle of getting from the airport without any data. Unfortunately that's not how it works in Taiwan.

## Running in Taipei

Taipei has big, wide pavements, traffic is minimal for a large Asian city, and the air quality is comparably good. So I know what you're thinking: Taipei must be a great city to go running in.

Yeah, not so fast.

While being in a city where the rule of law is followed almost to the letter is mostly a positive, the place where I really found it annoying was crossing the road. Even at tiny crossings where you can clearly see that there are no cars anywhere in the vacinity, people stand there and wait for the green man. At bigger crossings this can take a couple of minutes, so when you go anywhere on foot or by bike in Taipei, however long you think it's going to take, add on 25% for waiting to cross the street.

That's an annoyance on foot, but it downright ruins a perfectly good run, so unless you're willing to have a very stop-start run (I'm not), then I'd describe Taipei's streets as unsuitable for running. Thankfully you have some alternatives.

I only ran in [two] places in Taipei - [Da'an Park and the National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground], as I'll detail below, but Taipei is littered with viable alternatives, with the caveat that you must be comfortable going around and around in circles.

There are many running tracks dotted around the city, including on university campuses, so get onto Google maps and either by searching or looking at satellite view, you'll be able to find one pretty nearby to where you're staying.

For example though, there's a public running track on the grounds of the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZCX6j1c6f18mqFFw9'>Taipei Arena</ExternalLink>. I didn't run there myself, but I walked past it and it appeared free and open to the public. Or you could try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/jvkRjXzb42ZmehrA6'>Minquan Sports Park</ExternalLink> in the north of the city, or <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WWvK8UrzMCSeXe5o8'>Fukuwa Sports Park</ExternalLink> just over the river in New Taipei City, or the sports field at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/EU3kGExih4wgpto76'>National Taiwan Normal University</ExternalLink>, as well as several parks dedicated to sport such as <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftGcTddwfFSoRjQb8'>Wenshan Jingmei Sports Park</ExternalLink> or the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/hV1Q9JiH52D2shuP6'>Erchong Floodway Sports Park</ExternalLink>.

TODO: Add the NTU sports track to the above paragraph if you don't end up running there

In the unlikely event that you can't find something close to you, then because of the big, wide pavements in Taipei, just running around the block that you're staying in may be a possibility.

All of this is great if you don't mind running around in circles. For shorter runs and guided runs or runs when you're listening to an audiobook or a podcast, it can be nice to be running around a flat track where you don't really have to think about where you're going or where you're stepping. Doing that for long, slow runs will drive you crazy though, so if you want to actually run somewhere without having to stop to cross the road every two minutes, then the only place I went in Taipei that's viable is along the riverside.

Used more commonly by cyclists than runners (although you will see the occasional runner as well), the banks of both the Keelung River and the Tamsui River have concrete paths running along them, and are void of vehicles. I don't know how far these paths go, but through my time in Taipei I cycled along them for hours and never reached the end, so for running you can really go any distance you want. As an example, you could go from <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6ZeQnsouG1hTFkok7'>Guanshan Riverside Park to Tamsui MRT</ExternalLink>, a distance of 24.7km, running almost exclusively along the riverside. Tamsui MRT is on the red line, so you could get on a train and come straight back into town, or if that run isn't long enough for you, you could turn around and run back again, perhaps on the other side of the river, or along the Tamsui River instead of going back along the Keelung River.

So while the frustration of spending half your life waiting to cross the road initially makes Taipei feel like a city that's not so friendly to runners, once you've explored a bit you'll realise you have many options.

### Da'an Park

When you come to Taipei and ask people the best places to run, their first answer will invariably be <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiY7vbmaHAbbwqdMA'>Da'an Park</ExternalLink>.

Don't listen to them, it's shit.

It's a decent-sized park in the city centre with a roughly 2.2km circumference, and even better it includes a jogging track. Unfortunately, despite having almost an entire park of not jogging track to go on, people not jogging feel the need to not jog on the jogging track, so this narrow track will be populated with walkers, senile old people, groups of people, people in wheelchairs etc, much impairing your ability to jog on the jogging track.

Furthermore, if I ever encounter the person that designed Da'an Park, then I hope I'm carrying a mirror because they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. The jogging track goes around the outside of the park, but only three quarters of it. At the north end of the park it ceases existing, leaving you to navigate this part of the park on the paths, and Da'an Park is a very popular tourist spot, particularly with old people, and you know how slow and immobile they are. Making your way through the sea of wrinkles you're at times forced to slow to little more than a walk.

The best example I can give of how shit Da'an Park is for running, is if you ever come here you'll notice that far more people run on the pavement outside the park, than actually run in it. That is for a good reason.

<ImageGallery images={daanParkImages} />

### National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground

The <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vRTSQVCrP6U32Ha39'>National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground</ExternalLink>, as Google Translate tells me it's called (國立臺北科技大學運動場 in Chinese) is a 200m running track, open 24 hours per day on the National Taipei University of Technology campus obviously. This was where I did the majority of my running in Taipei.

For my first run here I did a steady 5k, which is 25 laps and is just depressing, going around and around and around and around. Luckily I was in terrible shape and in an attempt to recity this started doing guided HIIT runs and interval runs instead, and for this kind of run having a track, even just a 200m one, is perfect.

I don't think at any point I had to share the track with more than four other people, no matter what time of day I came, and being a small track on a university campus, it's pretty safe so you can bring a bag and leave it unattatended with little worry it'll get nicked, and there are toilets in the surrounding university buildings. Once I'd moved to my second room and coming here was a YouBike trip away, these luxuries were even more welcome.

It's basic and it's no thrills, but it does the job.
