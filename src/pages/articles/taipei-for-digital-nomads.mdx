TODO: Update this?

Taiwan's capital Taipei has a lot to offer any digital nomad that chooses to venture here. It's a modern city with an exciting backdrop of mountains and hiking trails. It offers an extensive and affordable network of public transportation, and is clean, spacious and offers a wide array of foods.

If you come here from South-East Asia you'll feel like you've taken a giant step up the social ladder. Everything is cleaner, everything is quieter, the people are more patient and the law is seen as more than just a suggestion. On the flip-side, it doesn't feel like it's really been "discovered" as a tourism destination. There is a small amount of tourism here - you won't be the only foreign face, but there's not enough that it's really changed for tourists.

## Why did I come to Taipei?

Taipei initially appealed to me as a destination because I wanted to go to Japan but couldn't afford to, and I'd been told that Taiwan is just like Japan but cheaper.

Now that I've been here I can confirm that it's just like how I imagine Japan is.

## Who is Taipei suitable for?

TODO: Update this?

Let me start by saying who Taipei is not suitable for. It is not a place to come if your goal when travelling is to get drunk and party as much as possible. I've read that Taiwan consumes the least alcohol of any east Asian country by far, and having been here it's hard to dispute that. It's not a country that has a drinking culture, and there isn't enough of a foreign presence that one's been built for the tourists.

When local people go out to bars, they typically only have one or two drinks. And while there are bars you can go to if you want to get drunk, unlike in many other places in the world, if you do it here you'll be the outlier.

It's also not a place where you really see people sitting in coffee shops on their laptops all day either. Being an island, Covid didn't affect Taiwan to the extent it did other places, so remote working isn't really a thing among local people, and it doesn't attract many digital nomads. So if you're a person that's attracted to the usual digital nomad hubs that offer a faux local culture that caters to foreigners, then Taipei isn't for you.

The people that Taipei is suitable for are those that are active. Almost all activities I did here were hiking or running or cycling or snorkelling etc. It's surrounded by mountains, so there is no end of hikes you can go on and places to explore.

Within the city itself, it's a place very comfortable with foreigners, but not to the extent the it's changed to cater to them. It's not a place where you're completely off the beaten path - if you want that then look elsewhere in Taiwan. On the other hand, if you want to go to a tourist-aimed city where everything is easy and translated to English, then it's not for you either. It sits in the middle. Comfortable and welcoming to foreigners, but not catering to them.

## Getting into Taipei

Taiwan offers nationals from many countries including the USA and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and many European countries (including the UK, Germany and France) a 90-day visa exemption. One of the requirements to get this exemption is an outbound air/sea ticket, but as I've found twice, it's not strictly enforced.

I've met several foreigners essentially living here on tourist visas, doing a visa-run to another country every 90-days, and never having issues getting back in.

## Paying for things in Taipei

Payment systems in Taipei are a bit of a mess, as that there's no universal payment method.

A lot of businesses allow payment by card, but unless you have a Taiwanese card these are not reliable. I had my UK card, that I've used without issue the world over, get rejected in multiple places because it was not issued by a Taiwanese bank.

Apple Pay is available in Taiwan, and in my experience is 100% reliable. You'll be able to use it at larger businesses like supermarkets, but it's certainly not widely available.

Similarly EasyCard (see below) is accepted in some bigger businesses, most notably 7-11, but is far from universal.

The most commonly accepted payment method is cash, and the good news is that the Bank of Taiwan offers free ATM withdrawals with a foreign card. That means that so long as you aren't charged by your home bank, you can at least get your hands on cash for free and cash is accepted at 99% of businesses. The issue I ran into on a couple of occasions, is there are a minority of businesses that don't accept cash.

One was a bicycle rental shop where, on returning our bikes, we were told the price and offered the payment methods of Line Pay, card payment or EasyCard. I tried to pay by card but it got rejected for not being issued by a Taiwanese bank, I don't have Line Pay, and I didn't have sufficient funds on my EasyCard.

After a lot of jostling, where the guy working in the shop wanted us to go all the way to the nearest MRT station to top-up our EasyCards (quite a long walk), he eventually conceded and accepted cash, but it highlighted the ridiculousness of paying for things in Taipei.

Unless you have a card issued by a Taiwanese bank, then make sure to carry enough cash on you because you will quite often need it.

### EasyCard

EasyCard is a contactless smartcard. It is the easiest method of paying to use the MRT, local buses and YouBikes. EasyCards can be bought and topped-up in any MRT station, and getting one should be the first thing you do arriving in Taiwan - you will use it everyday.

Obtaining an EasyCard requires paying a NT$100 deposit, as well as any money you want to top-up the card with. This deposit is used to pay the difference if you don't have enough money on your EasyCard to pay your entire fare.

## Arriving in Taipei

Assuming that you arrive in Taipei at Taoyuan International Airport then you can take the airport MRT to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/uGP4mHmgFYheBugt6'>Taipei Main Station</ExternalLink> in about 35 minutes. It costs NT$160 and you can pay with an EasyCard.

It doesn't run through the night, so if going to or from the airport late at night or early in the morning, you're either going to have to take a taxi or the airport bus, which does run all night.

## Getting around Taipei

Taipei is such an incredibly easy city get around. Not only does it have an extensive and affordable MRT and bus network that can be easily navigated by English speakers, but YouBike, Taipei's bike sharing scheme, is by far the best I've ever used. Between these, everywhere in Taipei's accessible.

### YouBike

YouBike (also Ubike) is my favourite thing about Taipei, and that's a pretty big statement. It's Taipei's bike sharing scheme, but it's done better here than anywhere else.

YouBike docks are everywhere. You can't walk five minutes without running into one, so no matter where you want to start or end your journey, you're going to be able to find a place to collect and return a YouBike. You can rent a bike with an EasyCard. You have to register on the app, but once you have, getting a bike is so easy. Press a button, scan your card, and you're away. To return it, place the bike into the dock, scan your card again, and that's it.

In order to encourage people to ditch their cars in favour of cycling, as of March '24 rentals of less than 30 minutes are free, and most of the time you get a YouBike, it's going to be for less than 30 minutes. I make 4+ YouBike trips everyday when I'm in Taipei; it's just how I get around, and even if you do rent the bike for longer than 30 minutes, the cost is negligible. It's an incredibly cheap way to travel.

The bikes are made by Giant, and Taipei is the most cycling-friendly city I've ever been to outside of Europe. Many pavements include cycle lanes, and cyclists are allowed (and expected) to use the pavements throughout the city. While you can cycle in the road if you choose, it's rarely necessary in the city centre.

A perhaps intentional side-effect of this, is that by making every pavement in Taipei cycle-friendly, it also makes Taipei the most wheelchair-friendly place I've ever been to. If you don't have legs you'll love it here.

In order to use YouBike, you need to download the YouBike app (<ExternalLink url='https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/youbike%E5%BE%AE%E7%AC%91%E5%96%AE%E8%BB%8A-2-0/id1483423095'>AppStore</ExternalLink>/<ExternalLink url='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.com.youbike.plus&hl=zh_TW&gl=US'>PlayStore</ExternalLink>). It can be set to English. On the app you can register your EasyCard (provided that you have a local phone number), see real-time maps of available YouBikes and empty docks, read some useful guides about how to use YouBike, and many other things. It's a very user-friendly app, even for English speakers.

Registering and renting a YouBike is a fairly straight forward process. If you're struggling, firstly look up the guides on the app. If they don't help enough, Googling how to use YouBike will yield some quite detailed articles that people have written. Unless you're really quite special, you'll be renting a YouBike in no time, and it's a joy. Fresh air, exercise, and you get to know the city so much better than travelling underground on the MRT.

### MRT

If you don't want to take a YouBike then the MRT is the easiest way to get around Taipei. Every sign and every map is translated to English, and on the rare occasions I had to deal with a human person (like when I bought my EasyCard) they spoke English.

Fares range from NT$20 to NT$65 (not including to/from the airport, which costs NT$160), with trains going walking distance to basically anywhere you're likely to want to go within the city. The trains are fairly modern, and while you can't always guarantee you're going to get a seat, I never experienced them getting so busy they were uncomfortable to travel on, even when travelling with luggage.

With signs in English, taking the MRT is pretty self-explanatory, but to give yourself a head-start, the Go! Taipei Metro app (<ExternalLink url='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/go-taipei-metro/id1111078688'>AppStore</ExternalLink>/<ExternalLink url='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.com.trtc.is.androideng&hl=en_GB'>PlayStore</ExternalLink>) includes a map, travel times, fares and other information.

### Bus

Figuring-out the bus network around Taipei (and all of Taiwan) is a lot easier than you might think, as it integrates very well with Google Maps, so getting directions to any destination will typically yield reliable results.

Taking the bus is easy - you get on at any door and you'll see a machine to scan your EasyCard, but note that you must scan your EasyCard when getting on **and** when getting off the bus. If you forget, you'll have to get your EasyCard unlocked before you can use it again, and will potentially have to pay a higher fare for the bus trip than you otherwise would.

## How affordable is Taipei?

Not very.

Once you're in Taipei, restaurants, groceries and transport are pretty cheap. You'll pay around NT$300 per restaurant meal in mid-range places, but if you eat in local restaurants you easily can pay less than NT$100. YouBike is free for the first thirty minutes, and even after that the cost is negligible, and apart from going to the airport, the maximum fare on the MRT is NT$65. The thing that's really going to hurt your wallet is accommodation.

What I paid for accommodation was on par with a mid-tier European city. Think of accommodation prices being equivalent to  Athens or Budapest - cheaper than Western Europe or North America, but much more expensive than Eastern Europe and South East Asia - in the region of NT1,900 per night (see below for the exact prices I've paid). And what you get for that money is comparatively unimpressive. Studio rooms with make-shift or non-existent kitchens.

## Is Taipei safe?

I don't even know if crime exists in Taipei. I'm usually very paranoid about the security of my possessions, but in Taipei I get very complacent because it's such a safe place.

In a city of 2.7 million people, it's mad to me that I would go out cycling with local people, and we'd just leave our bikes unlocked at the side of the road to go wandering around for a couple of hours, and I was the only person who feared they wouldn't be there when we returned. They always were.

It's a city where you can leave your wallet on the table while you go to the toilet, and it'll still be there when you get back. In that sense, I've never been to a place this safe before.

There are two safety concerns that hang-over Taipei, neither of which should worry you or stop you coming here.

The first is that China makes endless overtures about invasion. It'll probably never happen, but if it does you might want to not be here. The second is earthquakes...

## Will I die from an earthquake in Taipei?

TODO: Update this?

Probably.

One morning, shortly after I first arrived in Taiwan, I was brushing my teeth when the room started shaking. _"Well this is weird,"_ I thought to myself, although it did make brushing my teeth easier.

Apart from a couple of almost unnoticeable tremors, I'd never experienced an earthquake before, but I'd timed it to be in Taipei for the biggest one in 25 years. It left me a little shaken.

The Taiwan <ExternalLink url='https://www.cwa.gov.tw/V8/E/E/index.html'>Central Weather Administration</ExternalLink> reports all earthquakes, and from that point forth for the duration of my stay it reported regular aftershocks in Hualien - the site of the initial quake. Most of these were imperceptible in Taipei, but with ever-decreasing regularity through the duration of my stay, my room would just shake for a few seconds. By the end of my time here it had just become normal.

Taiwan is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, and as such is one of the countries most prepared for them, employing very strict building codes. So if you are going to get caught in an earthquake, this is one of the best places to do it.

## Should I get an eSim or a physical SIM in Taipei?

Typically I'd suggest just going with whichever is easier for you, but in Taipei I specifically suggest getting a physical SIM.

Why?

Because to rent YouBikes with your EasyCard, which I do 4+ times everyday, you need to have a local phone number, and with many eSIM operators you don't get a local phone number.

Not to mention that local networks offer phenomenal packages that you won't get with an eSIM.

## Getting a SIM card in Taipei

My suggestion for most countries in the world, is to ignore airport vendors selling SIM cards in airports because they typically sell tourist SIMs at inflated prices, whereas if you wait until your in town, you can instead get local deals.

I did that on my first stay here, making getting to my room a little troublesome with no network. Then I went to a Chunghwa branch (the biggest network operator in Taiwan), and not only would they only sell me a tourist SIM anyway as I was in the country on a tourist visa, but it took bloody ages because they weren't used to dealing with foreigners.

Don't do that in Taipei - the SIMs that you buy in the airport are the exact same packages at the exact same prices as you can in the city, and it's a Hell of a lot quicker.

On both of my visits, I've got a 90-day unlimited 4G SIM for NT$2,199. And this is legit unlimited, no throttling once you've used a certain amount of data, so you're safe no matter how much Pornhub you watch.

Tourist SIMs go up to 180 days in validitiy, but note that they cannot be topped-up. If you buy a 30-day tourist SIM for example, then decide to stay in the country a bit longer, you can't put more money onto it. You have to go back into a branch and go through the rigmarole of signing-up all over again.

    caption: 'Chunghwa tourist SIM prices - 30 days of unlimited data is NT$1,000, 90 days is NT$2,199.',
  },
]

## What language is spoken in Taipei?

Mandarin is the national language. While other languages, primarily Taiwanese are natively spoken, the vast, vast majority of what you hear will be Mandarin.

When setting the language on Google Translate, choose 'Chinese (Traditional)'. Traditional refers to the writing system. Simplified charcters were introduced on the Chinese mainland to increase literacy rates, but in Taiwan traditional characters are still used.

The one thing that took me a bit of getting used to in Taipei, is that locals may well assume that you speak Chinese.

In more touristy countries, Thailand for example, local people won't ever attempt to speak to you in the local language. The vast majority of foriegn visitors to Thailand don't speak Thai, and locals know that. Taipei is different.

There aren't that many foreigners here, and of those there are, many speak Mandarin. As such it's quite common for local people to come up to you and speak to you in Mandarin, then look shocked when you don't understand.

There is a decent amount of English spoken here, particularly by younger people, but it's not spoken by everyone.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Taipei?

Yes and no. It's easy enough to survive here with just English. The MRT is all in English, Google maps makes taking the bus easy, and in mid-range restaurants you'll typically find a menu in English. So you can get around and eat no problem.

That being said, the staff in supermarkets rarely speak English, nor do the building security guards, and in cheaper local restaurants the staff won't speak any English and the menu will only be in Chinese.

If you're not with a Chinese speaker, then communicating in such places requires Google Translate and a lot of awkwardness.

If you want to go to more local places (which you should), then try to make friends with someone that lives here first.

## How is the Internet in Taipei?

Mostly good, although in my last room it was utter dog shit. So although the infrastructure exists for fast connections, some places that you can stay will have cheaped-out on making the most of it, so double-check before booking.

If you get an unlimited SIM then using your mobile hotspot makes things a bit more bearable.

## Throwing away your rubbish in Taipei

After checking-into my first room in Taipei, I received a message from my Airbnb host telling me I had to throw away my rubbish in the correct government-issued bags, and if I didn't it would be returned to me by use of the building's CCTV. These bags weren't provided by the host, and finding where to buy them was the biggest source of stress for my first week in Taipei. I could not figure-out where to get these government-issued trash bags, so just kept all my rubbish in my room with me. I went to multiple supermarkets, 7-11s and Family Mart stores and looked in the usual places, but I could not find them anywhere.

Turns-out they store them behind the counter, and I eventually found some in Carrefour; see the picture below. So hopefully that prevents you having the same issue.

If you're staying in an apartment, that will likely be the end of your trash-related troubles because you'll be able to dispose of your rubbish in a communal area, and the building staff will take care of it from there. If not, well once you arrive here, you might notice what sounds like a loud ice cream van playing its music late into the evening. On my first night here I was trying to sleep thinking _"who on earth wants ice cream now?"_ It turns-out that is the sound played by the garbage truck so people know that it's nearby. And whereas in most places in the world you just leave your rubbish at the side of the road, in Taipei you have to put it into the truck yourself.

There will be two trucks in fact; one for rubbish and one for recycling. And if you're staying somewhere that doesn't take care of garbage communally, then every night or two, you're going to have to be out on the side of the road with the locals, waiting for the sound of Für Elise or another tune to indicate the garbage truck's nearby.

It's an issue so complicated to new arrivals in Taipei, that if you look on Google many people have written entire articles about how to throw away your rubbish (like <ExternalLink url='https://corissajoy.com/garbage-disposal-taiwan/'>this one</ExternalLink>).

The other trash-related thing to note is that there are very few public trash cans in Taipei. You'll find them in places like stations and parks, and occasionally on the street, but in general you've got to get used to taking your rubbish home with you.

I'll hasten to add: Please don't be one of the pricks that uses the baskets on the front of YouBikes as trash cans. If you take a YouBike, take your shit with you. Don't just leave it there for the next person to have to deal with.

The trash bags are the two shelves of blue things, behind those yellow crates.",

## Is the tap water drinkable in Taipei?

This is a question I've never been able to get a straight answer to. I've been told by locals that it's safe to drink, but we usually boil it first.

Well if it's safe to drink, why do you boil it first?

It was also explained to me that Taipei city produces clean, drinkable water, but that the piping and water tanks in some buildings, particularly older buildings, does pose a risk. So the safety of the water is ultimately going to depend on the building you're staying in.

So should you drink the water then?

The routine I've had during my 24 weeks here, is when drinking straight water, I drink only bottled water. Six-litre bottles are available at any supermarket for about NT$40. For everything else, including cups of tea, I use tap water. I've never had any issues.

## Things I didn't like about Taipei

Taipei is one of my favourite places in the world, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. There's still plenty here to annoy you.

Firstly, **the elderly** - Taipei has the worst old people I've ever encounterd.

In most of the world people have respect for their elders, but in Taipei it's just weird, and dare I say, abused, by their sense of entitlement.

On every MRT train for example, one quarter of the seats are dark blue priority seats. But even on full trains, these just sit their empty unless an old person gets on, because young people see it as disrespectful to sit in the old people chairs, even when they're empty. And if there are no priority seats available, you'll see old people get on, and stand uncomfortably close to a seated young person until they get up for them. They're often not even that old.

Or you'll see long queues of people waiting for a bus, and when it pulls up, some old people who haven't been queuing will just push to the front like they have some divine right to get on first. It's just a weird sense of entitlement that I haven't to an extent that I haven't seen anywhere else in the world.

Secondly, fuck **crossing the road** in Taipei.

This is the safest big city that I've ever been to, mainly because the law is strictly obeyed. That's great 99% of the time, but when people just stand there for minutes on end, refusing to walk across empty roads because the signal is red, it's just weird. You _can_ be given a fine for jay-walking, although it's rare (I have a local friend who got one). But unless you want to stand-out as a dumb foreigner, you too are going to have to spend half your life, quite literally, waiting to cross the road.

My third grievance, is why do people here **treat dogs like babies**? It's weird.

Perfectly healthy and able-bodied dogs that can and want to walk are being pushed around in buggies all over Taipei.

That exists everywhere in the world nowadays, but in Taipei they've taken it to a whole new level, and there's an entire industry dedicated to pretending dogs are babies.

Taipei also has the worst **urinals** in the world - they build them like slides your shins always get wet when you pee, **110v elecricity supply** means I can't use my blender in Taipei, and fuck anybody who leaves their **trash in YouBike baskets**, which happens a lot.

## Vegan restaurants in Taipei

Finding vegan restaurants in Taipei is easy - there are loads of them in all corners of the city. Finding vegan restaurants in Taipei that serve something other than local food is not so easy. Because of the modest tourist presence here, there's not that much to cater to the foreign market, so be prepared to either eat a lot of local food, or to travel a long way to find something else.

A peculiarity about Taipei restaurants that I hate, is that almost all all of them close for an hour or two in the mid-afternoon. Exact times vary by restaurant, but from roughly 2:30pm to 4:30pm everyday, almost all restaurants close. So if you're like me and don't always eat lunch strictly at lunchtime and sometimes like to eat a bit later, well fuck you, you can't.

More to my liking is that almost all restaurant provide free drinking water, and there's no expectation of buying a drink when you eat somewhere. Tipping is also not done in Taipei, and I've even seen locals get annoyed with a European we were with for suggesting that we leave a tip, because it's a custom that they don't want brought here. So when you go out, you pay for the food that you eat and nothing more, although note that some restaurants, usually more expensive ones, may add a mandatory 10% service charge.

There's such a breadth of vegan restaurants in Taipei that I couldn't even begin to detail all of them, but my most visited restaurant here is without doubt <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/tH7mRBdQqkZ91Qcg8'>Yuli Your Home</ExternalLink>. They're a fully vegan restaurant that serves local food. It's definitely not cheap, and since my first time in Taipei they've started adding 10% onto the menu price, which is one of my pet peeves. But still, I love the food here and it's an easy place to come if you don't speak Chinese because the menu is translated into English and the staff speak good English, so I still come here at least once per week when I'm in Taipei.

Just around the corner from Yuli is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SkJWg1NumruDyEoD6'>Loving Hut</ExternalLink>. They're a vegan chain that have branches of varying menus and quality all over the world, and if you dig-into them you'll find that some people condider them as an offshoot of a cult. That may or may not be true, but I find the food in this branch, a mix of local and Asian, really good quality, and decent value as well. The menu is translated to English and the staff speak some English. This is another of my regulars in Taipei.

During my first stay in Taipei I tore my calf muscle and couldn't walk very well for a while. However, I could cycle without issue, so started seeking-out far flung vegan food to cycle to so that I could stay active, and one of those was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/kk97aRCgZVQLKgmAA'>Burger Su Veggie</ExternalLink> in Beitou, north of the river. They're a vegetarian, rather than vegan restaurant, but 90% of the menu, which is translated into English, is vegan, and they're the best vegan burgers I've found in Taipei. Even once my leg was healed and throughout my second stay in Taipei I came back here again and again. It's a beautiful cycle along the river to get here, and the food is top quality junk food.

If you fancy some good Indian food, then <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/K5UXgwkVyRDXg2Nn6'>Mayur</ExternalLink> is part of a chain, however only this particular branch is vegetarian only. <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/3YrF2yJibMerbG7LA'>Falafel King</ExternalLink> is the best and only place I've found for falafel/hummus type dishes. It's a vegetarian restaurant, but their small menu has a couple of really good vegan options. <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/sRZpdGWsPAeerXXC7'>Vege Creek</ExternalLink> has several branches around Taipei, mostly located in food courts that are uncomfortably crowded at busy times, but come at a quieter times for a healthy feed. It's fully vegan, and you go in and put any items that you want from the fridge, into a shopping bag. You take it up and pay, and they'll make your items into a soup bowl.

## Getting vegan groceries in Taipei

There's good news and bad news when it comes to vegan grocery shopping in Taipei. The bad news is that there are two main supermarket chains here with branches all over the city - PX Mart and Carrefour, and neither are very vegan-friendly. You'll find the odd intentionally-vegan item, but in the main they do not cater to vegans at all, so beyond staple foods they aren't very good. Nor is Mia C'bon, a more upmarket but less plentiful supermarket chain in Taipei.

The good news is there are some stores in Taipei that are very vegan-friendly, you just have to know where to look. For example, <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/UepP1ZSueMgFW2oC9'>Noemi</ExternalLink> is a vegetarian supermarket located within Plantarium (a complex that also includes a vegan restaurant, vegan cooking classes, and a few other plant-based things). Noemi do sell a small number of items that include dairy or egg, however these are very clearly marked (in English) on the price labels, so you can know that if it doesn't say otherwise, what you're buying is vegan. The one downside that I found to Noemi, is that once they're out-of-stock of something, they never seem to get it back again. As I'm a creature of habit I found that frustrating.

Another place to checkout is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK4DDvkFDpdzBXJY6'>Leezen</ExternalLink> - a chain of almost-vegan stores with several branches throughout Taipei. They have annoyingly helpful staff who I wish would let you shop in peace, who on my first visit they told me that everything in store is vegan. That is not true, I found items containing milk so be slightly careful, but almost everything they sell is vegan. If you search for "Leezen" on Google Maps it takes you to a municipality in Germany, so search by its Chinese name, <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/hGkmUrXuUuHAvnF26'>里仁</ExternalLink> to find the branch nearest to you.

Some more good news is that if you're someone who eats a lot of nuts, and they make up most of my diet, then for some reason nuts are really good value in Taipei - I don't know why. Normally when I travel my nut expenditure takes up a concerning amount of my budget, but here you get a little respite. In PX Mart, for example, a 1.13kg tub of unsalted nuts is just NT$579.

The other thing to be mindful of here is that if you eat a lot of fruit, then the supermarkets aren't the best place to buy it. Your better bet is to go to the local fruit and veg shops that you'll find located every couple of blocks, where the selection is wider, the quality better, and the prices lower.

So if you're hungry at 3am with no food in your room, then heading to your nearest 7-11 you can at least get something.",
  },

## Getting vegan supplements in Taipei

When it comes to buying vegan supplements in Taipei, what I've found is that you are able to find everything that you need, you just might have to search for a while.

Watsons, Cosmed and Poya are three cosmetics chain stores that you'll find all over Taipei, and each branch has a supplements section. These are your best starting point when looking for something, although dont expect the labels to be in English nor the staff to speak English, and don't expect them to be labelled as vegan - I've spent a lot of time in these shops taking photos of Chinese ingredients labels on pill bottles and sending them off to ChatGPT for analysis to determine if they're both vegan, and actually any good.

### Protein

By far the best place I've found to buy protein supplements in Taipei is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/UepP1ZSueMgFW2oC9'>Noemi</ExternalLink>. They stock multiple brands of vegan protein powders, and have other high-protein products like protein bars and crisps, if they ever get them back in stock.

Some of these are local brands, so the prices are very fair. Expect to pay NT$799 for 1kg of protein powder.

If you don't want to go all the way to Noemi, more centrally-located is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/JyENPHbZbv1hBP4j7'>Spark Protein</ExternalLink>. They make their own products, and when I went here they did have a couple of vegan proteins, although the selection wasn't great.

### Multivitamins

The best vegan multivitamin I found in Taipei is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/aK4DDvkFDpdzBXJY6'>Leezen's</ExternalLink> own-brand multivitamin. At NT$650 for 60 capsules (30 days) it's not the cheapest. That honour belongs to Decathlon of all places, who sell a vegan multivitamin at NT$299 for 30 days.

I took the Decthlon one for three weeks, but after noticing a change in how I was feeling, I asked ChatGPT to compare it to the vitamin I'd been taking previously (that I'd brought with me from Europe). It told me that it was lacking in key ingredients for testosterone production (including zinc, magnesium, selenium and iron) and that I should switch over to the Leezen multivitamin, which was much more suitable.

I did, and within a week I was feeling a lot better.

Coincidence? Perhaps, but there's definitely a reason it only costs NT$299. I'd avoid it unless you're on a very tight budget, or just cheap like me.

Watsons also stock a vegan multivitamin with pretty packaging, but not only is it more nutrient deficient than Decathlon's, it's three times the price.

### Algae oil

If you're looking for algae oil, the two places that I found stocking it are Watsons and Leezen. Nutritionally both brands are comparable, and at NT$715 for 30 days, Leezen is better value that Watsons' NT$980, except for the fact that Watsons' is perennially available on buy-one-get-one-free. For as long as that lasts then go to Watsons, if not go to Leezen.

<ImageGallery images={veganAlgaeOilImages} />

### Calcium

The only place I've found to buy vegan calcium, is of all places, PX Mart, where in bigger branches you find a decent-sized supplement sections.

The packaging only says vegetarian, but ChatGPT insists that it's vegan, and I haven't found anything else in Taipei. 60 tablets costs NT$741, and they recommend taking four per day, but that's excessive. I took two per day, so they lasted me 30 days.

    caption: "In PX Mart you'll pay NT$741 for Lovita calcium tablets.",
  },
]

<ImageGallery images={veganCalciumImages} />

### Magnesium

For magnesium, the only vegan brand I've found here is also Lovita (and the magnesium does specifically say 'vegan' on the label). These I haven't found in PX Mart. Instead you can get them in branches of Poya for NT$880 for 60 days worth.

<ImageGallery images={veganMagnesiumImages} />

### Zinc

I've found two vegan brands of zinc in Taipei - Uniqman and Lovita. They're nutritionally comparable, so go with Uniqman as it's noticeably cheaper. Both are available in Cosmed at NT$490 for 60 tablets of Uniqman or NT$680 for 60 tablets of Lovita. I only take one every two days, so this is 120 days worth for me.

## Running in Taipei

TODO: Update this

Taipei has big, wide pavements, traffic is minimal for a large Asian city, and the air quality is comparably good. So I know what you're thinking: Taipei must be a great city to go running in.

Nope.

While being in a city where the rule of law is followed almost to the letter is mostly a positive, the place where I really found it annoying was crossing the street. Even at tiny crossings where you can clearly see that there are no cars anywhere in the vacinity, people stand there and wait for the green man. At bigger crossings this can take a couple of minutes, so when you go anywhere on foot or by bike in Taipei, however long you think it's going to take, add on 25% for waiting to cross the road.

That's an annoyance on foot, but it downright ruins a perfectly good run, so unless you're willing to have a very stop-start run (I'm not), then I'd describe Taipei's streets as unsuitable for running. Thankfully you have some alternatives.

I ran in four different locations in Taipei - Da'an Park, the National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground, the National Taiwan University sports field, and along the riverside. I'll detail each of these places below, but Taipei is littered with viable alternatives, with the caveat that you must be comfortable going around in circles.

There are many running tracks dotted around the city, including on university campuses, so get onto Google maps and either by searching or looking at satellite view, you'll be able to find one pretty nearby to where you're staying.

For example there's a public running track on the grounds of the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZCX6j1c6f18mqFFw9'>Taipei Arena</ExternalLink>. I didn't run there myself, but I walked past it and it appeared free and open to the public. Or you could try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/jvkRjXzb42ZmehrA6'>Minquan Sports Park</ExternalLink> in the north of the city, or <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WWvK8UrzMCSeXe5o8'>Fukuwa Sports Park</ExternalLink> just over the river in New Taipei City, or the sports field at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/EU3kGExih4wgpto76'>National Taiwan Normal University</ExternalLink>, as well as several parks dedicated to sport such as <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ftGcTddwfFSoRjQb8'>Wenshan Jingmei Sports Park</ExternalLink> or the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/hV1Q9JiH52D2shuP6'>Erchong Floodway Sports Park</ExternalLink>.

In the unlikely event that you can't find something close to you, then because of the big, wide pavements in Taipei, just running around the block that you're staying on may be viable.

All of this is great if you don't mind running around in circles. For shorter runs and guided runs or runs when you're listening to an audiobook or a podcast, it can be nice to be running around a flat track where you don't really have to think about where you're going or where you're stepping. Doing that for long, slow runs will drive you up the wall though, so if you want to actually run somewhere without having to stop to cross the road every two minutes, then the only place I went in Taipei that's viable is along the riverside.

### Da'an Park

When you come to Taipei and ask people the best places to run, their first answer will invariably be <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/iiY7vbmaHAbbwqdMA'>Da'an Park</ExternalLink>.

Don't listen to them, it's shit.

It's a decent-sized park in the city centre with a roughly 2.2km circumference, and even better it includes a jogging track. Unfortunately, despite having almost an entire park of not jogging track to go on, people not jogging feel the need to not jog on the jogging track, so this narrow track will be populated with walkers, senile old people, groups of people, people in wheelchairs etc, much impairing your ability to jog on the jogging track.

Furthermore, if I ever encounter the person that designed Da'an Park, then I hope I'm carrying a mirror because they need to have a long, hard look at themselves. The jogging track goes around the outside of the park, but only three quarters of it. At the north end of the park it ceases existing, leaving you to navigate this part of the park on the paths, and Da'an Park is a very popular tourist spot, particularly with old people, and you know how slow and immobile they are. Making your way through the sea of wrinkles you're at times forced to slow to little more than a walk.

The best example I can give of how shit Da'an Park is for running, is if you ever come here you'll notice that far more people run on the pavement outside the park, than actually run in it. That is for good reason.

### National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground

The <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vRTSQVCrP6U32Ha39'>National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground</ExternalLink>, as Google Translate tells me it's called (國立臺北科技大學運動場 in Chinese) is a 200m running track, open 24 hours per day on the National Taipei University of Technology campus. This is where I did the majority of my running in Taipei.

For my first run here I did a steady 5k, which is 25 laps and is just depressing, going around and around and around and around. Luckily I was in terrible shape and in an attempt to rectify that started doing guided HIIT runs and interval runs instead, and for this kind of run having a track, even just a 200m one, is perfect.

I don't think at any point I had to share the track with more than four other people, no matter what time of day I came. Taipei is already incredibly safe, and being a small track on a university campus, you can bring a bag and leave it unattended with little worry it'll get nicked, and there are toilets in the surrounding university buildings.

It's basic and it's no thrills, but it does the job.

### National Taiwan University Sports Field

I tore my right calf muscle midway through my stay in Taipei, and it's with regret that I only ran at National Taiwan University as part of my recovery, because they have a really nice running track. Much nicer than the National Taipei University of Technology Sports Ground (above). It's blue, and I don't know what it is about blue, but running on a blue track makes you want to run faster. I had to hold myself back from breaking-into a sprint and reinjuring myself.

There are YouBike docks dotted all over the campus, including immediately next to the running track, so getting here is easy. It's a nine-lane running track, yet there were never more than five or six other runners any time that I came. Being a university campus, you can leave a bag at the side of the track with little fear it'll go for a walk, and the adjacent buildings have toilets in.

### Riverside

The banks of both the Keelung River and the Tamsui River have concrete paths running along them, and are void of vehicles (other than bicycles).

I only ran along the riverside twice, but I cycled along it a lot and I didn't go anywhere that was unsuitable for running. For example, I cycled from <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/QRQovfE1q2jAWsWQ6'>Raohe Evacuation Gate to Tamsui MRT</ExternalLink>, a distance of 25.4km. This route is exclusively along the vehicle-free riverside path, and is very suitable for running. Tamsui MRT is on the red line, so you can get on a train and come straight back into town, or if that run isn't long enough for you, you can turn around and run back again to do a 50k ultra. That route doesn't include the beginning nor the end of the riverside path (I have no idea where they are), so you really can just keep going to your heart's content.

Or if you're not staying on that side of the city, the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GdAKTw2SoT9XWyrFA'>Tamsui River</ExternalLink> is just as runnable. I never ran here because it wasn't near to where I was staying, but I did cycle the above route after going to Burger Su when I needed some exercise burn off the calories - this riverside path is also vehicle-free and very running-friendly.

If you're a runner who likes to actually go somewhere (and not just around in circles), the frustration of spending half your life waiting to cross the road might initially make Taipei feel like an unfriendly running city. The riverside is the great equaliser, and whether walking, running or cycling, should be explored while you're here.

## Being sociable in Taipei

TODO: Update this?

There is a very active Meetup community in Taipei. Pretty much everyone I got to know here, I either met at a Meetup, or I met through someone that I met at a Meetup.

While there are some events centred around alcohol, they are in the minority with hiking and outdoor activity groups, fitness groups, and language exchange groups being much more popular. I attended the weekly event of the <ExternalLink url='https://www.meetup.com/language-friendship/'>Language Friendship</ExternalLink> consistently while in Taipei. Each event attracted up to sixty people, with some regular attendees and some new people each week, so was a really great resource to get to know people. If that doesn't look your kind of thing, there are many other groups to try.

The only real downside I found is that almost every group has its events on the weekend (usually Saturday). On weekdays there isn't so much going on.

## Staying in Taipei

TODO: Update this?

Accommodation takes-up a disproportionate amount of your budget in Taipei. While things like transport, groceries and restaurants are really good value here, accommodation is not; at least not for short-term visitors. Locals with long-term leases did insist on telling me that I was paying excessively by staying in Airbnbs (more excessively than in other places in the world), but in checking the usual places (Airbnb, Agoda, booking.com etc) I didn't really find anything that was better value than what I paid.

There are definitely cheaper rooms available than those I stayed in, but at the sacrifice of facilities or location.

I stayed in three different areas in Taipei, and I loved all of them. With the exception of Ximen, I didn't go anywhere in Taipei that I didn't like. The perfect area for me is perhaps around Da'an Park/NTU - it's always nice to have a big park nearby, NTU makes it a relaxed studenty area, the campus has a gorgeous running track, and two of my favourite vegan restaurants are nearby. By taking a YouBike though, anywhere in the city is quickly and cheaply accessible, so I'd focus more on the accommodation than its location.

As for why I don't recommend Ximen - I only went there one time. It was to check-out the area as I found that accommodation there was cheaper than in other parts of the city. With good reason. It's crowded, full of tourists and homeless people, and is generally awful. Unless you like shopping, and I hate shopping, there's nothing nice about it.

The reason that the rest of Taipei is so nice, is that all the shit bits of Taipei are in Ximen.

<AccommodationTable stays={zhongzhengApartmentStays} />

At the time I stayed here, this apartment near Zhongxiao Xinsheng MRT was the second most expensive place I'd stayed as a digital nomad, so you might think it's rather lavish.

Nah, accommodation in Taipei is just expensive. It's tiny, but it does have all the essentials and I loved the location.

The number one thing I look for when choosing accommodation is that it gets a lot of daylight. Nothing puts me on the path to depression quicker than waking up in a dingy room, and with its big windows I thought this room would be sufficient. And it is, with one caveat.

The room is in the centre of a horseshoe of rooms. With the bed right next to the window, if you leave the blackout blinds open, people in the adjacent rooms can look in and watch you sleep, so staying here is a bit of a battle between leaving the blinds open enough that daylight gets in, but not so much that you wake up with people looking at you. Closing the left blind completely and half-closing the right one was the best middle-ground I found, but even then people in some of the higher rooms can still look down at you in bed, which is a bit weird.

That aside, I'd say that this room has everything that you need... but only just. For example, there isn't a kitchen but there is a plug-in hob and a pan that you can use on the desk. That desk is the only surface in the apartment, so you have a workstation and you have a kitchen, just not at the same time.

There's only one sink in the apartment too. It's a bit weird brushing your teeth next to a draining rack and with a dish-cloth in the sink. You do have a bathroom sink and a kitchen sink, but again, just not at the same time. These aren't issues unless you want them to be, because if you're here alone it's unlikely you're going to be brushing your teeth while doing the washing up, but it is something to be aware of.

And while it is a compact room, by laying my mat diagonally I had space to exercise while playing my workouts on the TV. The sofa's comfortable enough as an alternative workstation, and I had absolutely no issues with the wifi throughout my stay. The buttons on the space-age washing machine are all labelled in Chinese and Google Translate is only so helpful. Doing your laundry is a little bit of pot-luck, but my clothes always came out cleaner than they went in.

If you search on Airbnb, you will find bigger rooms for cheaper. One thing you're paying for to stay here is the great location, and it is a great location. Zhongxiao Xinsheng MRT station is a short walk away. That's on the blue line just two stops from Taipei Main Station, so everything in Taipei is within easy access, but most things you need are actually walking distance.

The street that the apartment's on, including the building that it's in, is almost solely electronics shops, so if you like tech you'll be living your wet dream. There are loads of little eateries nearby, including the vegetarian branch of Mayur Indian Kitchen if you want vegan/vegetarian food, as well as a Carrefour supermarket. It's very close to the National Taipei University of Technology, making it a studenty area, but more importantly being walking distance to the university's running track. Da'an Park is a slightly longer walk (or a short YouBike ride) but is still easily accessible on foot.

I at no point felt I was living a life of luxury when I stayed here. For the price I perhaps should have done. But it had everything I needed so I was comfortable for my month here.

The best middle-ground I found was to entirely close the left blind while sleeping, and to half-close the right one. It didn't give me total privacy, but it did at least stop the apartment immediately to the left being able to see in from about a metre away, which would be weird, and it let in enough light that I at least rose with daylight.",

As there's only one surface in the apartment, the desk serves as both a workstation and a kitchen surface.

A limited amount of utensils and crockery are provided, although I think they just threw-in whatever they had lying around because it includes two dinner knives, but no forks.

This room has the same Airbnb hosts as the room above and costs almost exactly the same. Which is better then? Well it's actually quite hard to pick between them.

This room is in Xinyi, about a 5 minute walk from the Taipei 101/World Trade Center MRT station. That's a less central, but equally vibrant location. The apartment is on a main road with everything you need within an easy walk. Restaurants galore, and the nearest supermarket (PX Mart) is only 2 minutes away. There's a small park about 30 metres from the building entrance, that contains some very convenient YouBike docks. It's not the nicest park in the world so had little significance to me, until I injured my leg and became very immobile. At that point being able to hobble around the corner to this park and sit there reading my book while getting some daylight became invaluable to my mental health.

If you look at the pictures below, you might think that with its large windows, this apartment gets loads of natural light. Bzzzz, wrong. The sign for a business covers the top half of the window severely limiting the light that gets in (and the view to the outside), and as this room's only on the first floor, for any privacy you need to keep the blinds at least partially shut as well, so I found myself getting less light than in the room above. Where it does exceed my previous room, is that it's just that little bit more spacious, and that little bit better equipped.

Moving the coffee table out of the way, there's ample floor space to exercise here. It also has a desk, and a separate kitchen area including sink, so you can have a workstation setup, cook your lunch, and brush your teeth all at the same time like some kind of king. Although worth noting that the washing machine in this room firstly doesn't use any hot water, so my clothes never came out very clean, and secondly isn't a drying machine. There's a hanging rail and loads of coat hangers which is a sufficient alternative.

As with the room above, the included equipment is a little sporadic. There's a large pan and a large skillet to cook with, but only two very small bowls to eat from. And there's a chopping board, but no cutting knife. Not a problem if you carry your own equipment, but something to be aware of if you don't. I didn't have any issues with the wifi throughout my stay.

After a tempered start where I had to adjust to the lack of daylight, I grew to really like this room. I'd happily come back again.

<AccommodationTable stays={zhongshanApartmentStays} />

Staying here was a last minute decision when I decided to extend my time in Taipei. Considering that it could have been a lot worse.

Although I booked it on Airbnb, I would consider it more of a hotel room than an apartment. The room got fully cleaned once during my stay but staff come through the floor every day, so if you want fresh towels, for example, leave your dirty towels outside the room and they'll replace them. I also don't think any residents, at least on my floor, are long-term. In both of the rooms adjacent to mine, the tenants rotated a lot. I know that because the walls are frustratingly thin. That's the biggest flaw of this room.

It's on a main road, and there is some very impressive sound-proofing to ensure the sounds from the road below don't disturb you. Unfortunately they spent all their efforts sound-proofing from the road, and made no effort to sound-proof from other rooms so you can have a nice bedtime story if the people in the next room are talking into the night.

With that exception I can't really fault this room. It has huge, east-facing windows next to the bed that get so much glorious daylight in the mornings. That is without doubt its best feature, but the desk and chair are pretty comfortable to work at, and I should mention it has one of the best showers I've ever had. So powerful, it's like getting a free massage in the morning. The wifi is fast and reliable, the bed is comfortable, there's plenty of space to store your clothes, the AC is cold and there's a not very thoughtfully-placed fridge.

It's below the TV. I thought about trying to move it, but there wasn't really an alternative place. The reason it's so annoying is that if like me, you like to use your TV for exercise then you're going to struggle. Once you're lying on the floor you can't see the TV because someone put a fridge in the way. I had to do workouts on my phone.

There are no washing facilities in the room, but there's a washer and dryer shared by the rooms on the sixth floor. The washer is free with detergent provided, the dryer costs NT$50 (you need 5x NT$10 coins). As there's a clothes horse in the room, unless you're in a rush you're not going to need the dryer.

The location of the room is pretty awesome. A PX Mart supermarket is literally just across the street, with a YouBike dock being similarly close. Xingtian Temple MRT station is about a five minute walk from the room. There are a couple of fruit shops less than ten minutes walking from the room, and a limited amount of vegan food available nearby. When I wanted to run I'd grab a YouBike from outside the room, cycle for ten minutes and drop it <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/bVL8dsK1gyYrP1AbA'>opposite the Fine Arts Park</ExternalLink>, then walk to the river from there.

Considering staying here was a last minute decision I was pretty happy with how it turned out - in many ways it's a really nice room. Just be aware that the sanctity of your stay will be determined by the bedtime and the thoughtfulness of the people in the adjacent rooms. If you're unlucky enough to have noisy neighbours that stay up late each night, you're probably not going to have a good time.

<AccommodationTable stays={xinyiAnheApartmentStays} />

My stay in this Xinyi Anhe apartment got off to a shaky start. The host, Steve, was in Calfornia for the duration of my stay, and his friend that usually helps him while he's out the country was unavailable. The check-in instructions say that you'll be met by the host or his friend, but as none were available, I had to figure-out self check-in on a listing that really isn't setup for it.

I was then told that it was really important that his friend come and show me how to dispose of my garbage while I'm here. But as she was only available on a day I was out hiking all day, it suddenly became much less important and I was left to figure it out for myself.

All of this while communicating with someone in a California timezone was a bit of a ballache, but we got there. And I grew to like this room, but what I will say, is it feels like a room managed by someone 6,000 miles away. What I mean, is that is was cleaned before I arrived, but to about the minimum acceptable standard. If I was a cleaner working on minimum wage and I knew that the person paying me was out of the country, I'd probably do the minimum as well.

There are two air conditioners in the room - one in the living area, and one in front of the bed. The latter is in deperate need of a service as it rattles loudly enough to keep you up at night, turns-off spordically, and doesn't really pump-out much cold air. That's the kind of thing that a host would check and notice were they to ever come to the room. And you were very aware of the presence of previous guests here.

For example, a lot of food had been left by previous tenants, and I'm not just talking about useful things like salt and pepper and oil. There was a jar of apricots in the cupboard, except there were no apricots left in it, just the water that they came in. Something that would have been handled by a cleaner that was held accountable, but as the host's not in the country...

That was the introduction to this room, but once I was past that, it's a pretty decent place.

It's in Xinyi, which is one of my favourite parts of Taipei. Of my 24 weeks staying in Taipei, 12 have been in Xinyi, and that's not an accident. Despite being close to Taipei 101, it doesn't have very many tourists here, and I like the vibe of this area. The MRT, buses and YouBikes are very easily accessible from the room. And the room itself is decent.

It's up on the 11th floor, but don't expect any kind of view unless you really enjoy looking at the building opposite. It's also worth noting that construction is ongoing on a new building outside the window, but despite this being audible, it was never loud enough that it bothered me.

You have to get used to pretty basic accommodation in Taipei - that's just the way it is here. You can't expect amenities like you'd find in a European Airbnb. Understanding that caveat, you have everything you need here.

I didn't have any issues with the wifi during my stay. On my one speedtest it recoreded a 469mbps download speed and a 46mbps upload speed, but more importantly, it was a stable connection. There's a desk and a chair that you can comfortably work and eat at, but I also found both the sofa and the armchair by the window comfortable to sit at on my laptop too. The armchair is next to a large window, which gets a bit of direct sunlight in the morning, but is mostly blocked by the building opposite. The bed is up on a raised platform. You get some daylight up there at daybreak if you like to rise with the sunrise like I do, but it could definitely do with a bit more.

The room has a kitchen with a kettle, one hob, and a couple of pans. It's sufficient for minimal cooking, but again temper your expectations if you're used to European Airbnbs. There's also a washer/dryer that works great, except it doesn't like to give you your clothes back again. The only way that I found to open the door was with anger. If I kicked it enough, eventually it would give-up and open so that I could get my clothes out. Through no amount of waiting did it ever release on its own.

Moving the coffee table out of the way, in the space between the sofa and the TV is enough space to exercise.

It's definitely a no frills apartment, but I had no major issues during my stay either, and was perfectly comfortable. By Taipei standards it could definitely be worse.

This room is more expensive than my previous stays, but given its then-high rating on Airbnb, coupled with how big, well-equipped and well-located it is, I figured it would be worth it, for a stress-free stay. And it's all those things.

It noticeably larger than any of my previous rooms. Even having a desk and chair, a separate dining table, and a sofa with coffee table, it still has more empty space than any of my other rooms. The kitchen here is more complete than anywhere else I've stayed in Taipei, with a hob and pots and pans, and a microwave and even a toaster oven. And the location is really decent, depending on what you're looking for.

I'd say that I prefer the vibe of staying in Xinyi - it feels more local, but this is by no means a bad area, and its central location is much easier for getting around. It excellent local infrastructure including two nearby MRT stations serving the green, yellow and brown lines, a busy bus stop just around the corner, and a couple of easily-walkable YouBike docks, as well as nearby restaurants, several local supermarkets, and branches of Watsons, Cosmed, Poya and even LeeZen within a very easy walk. With all that being said, do I recommend staying here?

Absofuckinglutely not.

Why? Because the Internet absolutely sucks.

With all the effort that's gone into making this such a nice place to stay, it's absolutely bewildering that they've cheaped-out on the wifi, but the connection here is God-awful.

It's not that it's slow - the speeds are more than fast enough for video calls and anything else you're likely to do. It's that the connection's consistently unstable. Simple tasks like loading a webpage or sending a message to ChatGPT will lose connection, and at times it feels like you're back on dial-up.

For my entire six-week stay, at least three times per day my neighbours got used to hearing _"Oh for fuck's sake I just want to load a fucking webpage - fuck this fucking room I fucking hate this fucking place."_

My blood pressure went through the roof when I was staying here. It's a connection that's inexcusably bad in 2025. And I assume that if you're reading this article then you're who needs a good connection, so do not stay here.

Everything else about the room is great. It's spacious, nicely decorated and well-equipped with pretty much everything you're going to need, and has the best toilet I've ever had (although I wasn't given enough of many essentials like toilet paper or laundry detergent for a six-week stay, so had to buy them myself). It even has loads of cat decorations and Nintendo memorabilia, which is being stored here disguised as decoration, but is still quite nice.

But I would not stay here again simply for how shit the wifi is, and I recommend that you don't either.
