Visitors from many countries (including the US, UK, Australia and most of western Europe) can enter Thailand with no pre-approval on a 30 day tourist visa waiver.

For those who wish to stay as a tourist for longer there are two options:

- Enter Thailand on a 30 day tourist visa waiver and extend it for another 30 days once in the country
- Get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa before entering Thailand (this can also be extended for a further 30 days)

To get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa you're going to have to visit a Thai embassy, and the focus of this article is doing so in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

## How long does it take to get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane?

If, like me, you last went through this process in Vientiane prior to February 2019, then it may surprise you to learn that you now need to make an appointment at the embassy. In the past you could get a night-train from Bangkok to Nong Khai, cross the border to Laos, take a tuk-tuk straight to the embassy, join a (long) queue to apply for a visa, pick-up your passport the next day and go straight back to Thailand again.

For anyone planning on doing that today, I'll stress that this is no longer the case and you should plan on at least two weeks to complete the entire process, with a minimum of three working days needed in Vientiane.

I believe that doing the visa application in Savannakhet (southern Laos) you can still show up without an appointment and be approved within 24 hours. I haven't done this myself, so I can't say with certainty.

## Making an appointment

To get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane, the first step is to make an appointment at the consular section of the Thai embassy. You do that at <ExternalLink url='https://www.thaivisavientiane.com/'>thaivisavientiane.com</ExternalLink>.

Click 'Book your Appointment', and you'll have to click firstly through a warning, and then agree to some terms and conditions. These can be mostly ignored, although the one worth noting is:

> If you do not show for your scheduled appointment, there is a 30 day suspension rule for your account and if you cancel your appointment, we will impose a 10 day suspension for your account.

Ensuring that you show up at the embassy whether you have Covid or not, your account is suspended if you renege on your appointment. As your account is linked to your passport number, there is no option of just creating a new account if you get suspended, so be certain of your appointment time.

Agreeing to the terms and conditions page, you'll be taken to a page to 'Login to your Account'. As you don't have an account yet, click the 'Sign Up Now' link.

After agreeing that you won't input any inaccurate information, you'll be shown a 'Sign Up For New Applicant' form. This form requires your first name, middle name, last name, email address, contact number, passport number and nationality. Enter these and click 'Sign Up'.

If the sign-up is successful, you'll see an alert that says:

> Your new account is now registered
>
> Please log-in to your email account and verify your registration by using the username and password sent to your registered email address.

When I did this, I waited for around 30 minutes and no such email ever appeared. In concluding there had been an error, I tried to sign-up again, and this was the point that I found-out that I was blocked from re-registering, as my passport number had already been used.

What I instead had to do was to go back to the 'Login to your Account' page and click the 'Forgot your password Click here' link. This opens up a form to enter your email address and passport number. On submitting this form I did finally receive an email which included a password I could use to login with.

With that password, head back to the 'Login to your Account' screen, enter your email address, this password, and in the 'Security Code' input, just copy the code from above the input (or click on 'Copy Code' to enter it automatically). I've never seen such a futile attempt at security, but whatever floats your boat.

You should now be signed-into the app, at which point you'll see a list of available appointments, with unavailable days greyed-out.

At the time I did this on the 29th of December, the next available appointment was on the 5th of January, one week away. I've read online of people having to wait two weeks for the next appointment, hence why you should start the process a way in advance of needing the visa.

Click 'Book Appointment' on the available slot you desire, at which point you should be able to go to the 'My Appointment(s)' section where you will see the date and time of your appointment.

You will also receive an email confirming your appointment. This email will also contain other information such as your queue number, which is largely useless but in theory denotes your timeslot at the embassy. My queue number of 30 meant I was supposed to show-up between 9:30am and 10am.

I showed-up about 9:15am and no one cared, so I wouldn't pay much attention to it.

You will require this email in order to enter the embassy. Either printing it or showing it on your phone screen are sufficient.

## Preparing for the appointment

I'd read conflicting information about whether I'd be able to print documents and exchange money at the embassy. Regardless, the more prepared I am and the less I have to do on the day, the less stressful it is, so I decided I'd get as much as I could done the day before my appointment.

### Required documents

The full list of officially required documents is as follows:

1. A completed application form
1. Two passport-sized photos, taken in the last 6 months
1. Your passport, valid for at least 6 months (it must have a blank page for the visa)
1. A photocopy of your passport's information page
1. A photocopy of your Laos visa
1. A photocopy of your Laos entry stamp
1. Three months of bank statements showing an average balance of 20,000 baht
1. Your travel booking going into Thailand
1. A travel booking out of Thailand (usually meaning an outbound flight)
1. Your travel itinerary while in Thailand (this can mean hotel bookings for your entire stay)

The list of actually required documents depends on the whim of the immigration official that day. Numbers 1 to 6 will be always be required. Numbers 7 to 10 are pot-luck.

Being asked for proof of travel into Thailand is unlikely, as being so close to the Thai border many people will just go themselves without any advanced booking. The application form includes a 'Proposed Address in Thailand' section, of which if you were to put somewhere near to the Laos border (Nong Khai or Udon Thani), then having advanced travel booked would be absurd.

In my various entries into Thailand over the years, I have never once had outbound travel booked. On the one occasion I was asked for it, I just said I planned on leaving by land, and that was enough to satisfy the border official.

If you have an outbound flight booked then obviously bring a copy of your booking. If you don't, because like me you don't plan two months in advance, then I'd suggest trying your luck without one. I've always managed.

Come up with a valid explanation for why you don't have an outbound flight, in case you get asked. For example you're going to travel by land to Malaysia. If that is unsuccessful then be prepared to pony-up for a flight ticket.

In that case, if you have an inkling of where you might go, then get a flight to your most likely destination, and if you really have no clue then get onto Skyscanner and get the cheapest flight you can find. It just has to be a flight from anywhere in Thailand, to anywhere outside Thailand, within 60 days of what you've written as your date of arrival in Thailand on your application form.

You can almost always find a flight for less than 1,300 baht.

Being asked to prove your entire travel itinerary within Thailand is unlikely. More common is they'll want to see evidence if your first accommodation. If you don't have anywhere booked yet then be ready to jump on booking.com or Agoda. Many hotels offer refundable bookings, so you can make a booking, print it out, and cancel it right after, although beware that the address of the booking you print-out must match the 'Proposed Address in Thailand' answer that you gave on the application form.

Prior to this application I'd never been asked to prove my finances, but on this occasion I was. More on that below.

### Gathering documents

If you arrive at the embassy without a completed application form, they will give you one free of charge and there is a table with pens to complete it. It is not necessary to complete before arriving at the embassy.

If you do want to print and complete it before going to the embassy then it can be downloaded from <ExternalLink url='https://www.thaivisavientiane.com/'>thaivisavientiane.com</ExternalLink> (the same site used to make the appointment) by clicking 'Download Application Form'.

There are many places around Vientiane to print documents and make copies. Many of these can also take and print passport photographs. I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/za5jiiyDVZnYKvR26'>Idea Copy Center</ExternalLink>. I already had two photographs and didn't have to make any print-outs, so just needed the three relevant pages of my passport photocopied. For this I was charged 2,000 kip.

They can also do print-outs and passport photographs here. The woman working here was very friendly and spoke good English.

### Getting baht

Applying for a Thai visa in Vientiane costs 1,000 baht. You can only pay in baht; dollars are not accepted, kip is not accepted.

If you're coming to Vientiane from Thailand and you know in advance that you'll be doing a visa application, then I strongly suggest bringing 1,000 baht with you. I wish I had.

If you wander around Vientiane, you see currency exchanges everywhere. Most banks advertise as exchanging currency. As I found out the hard way, they only exchange from foreign currencies into kip, not the other way around. Presumably the government doesn't allow it.

I went to nine different exchanges, including the cluster of Thai banks that peculiarly sits in Vientiane, and asked if I could exchange kip to baht. At each one I was told no, and at each one I asked where I could do this. No one knew.

The collective brilliance of Thailand requiring visa fees in Laos to be paid in baht, with Laos simultaneously not allowing exchange to baht, really is some next-level ineptitude.

I'd somehow given myself food poisoning on this day, and spent all morning throwing up. Wandering around in the Vientiane heat hungry, dehydrated, and trying not to shit myself was not my idea of fun. I was about to give up and go back to my room, but decided to try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/d6qCJtAFhDY5WN4R6'>one more exchange</ExternalLink> that was showing up on Google Maps, where the most recent reviews mentioned that the exchange is no longer there, but there's a woman who sits nearby and approaches foreigners asking if they want to exchange cash.

I didn't really think that would be the most reliable service, but I was close by so I walked down, and sure enough, right before I got to where this currency exchange was according to Google Maps, a woman saw me and shouted "exchange".

I wouldn't normally advise exchanging money with random people in the street, but the reviews I'd seen all read very positively, and I was kind of at the end of my rope by this point.

I already knew that the official rate was 1,000 baht = 600,000 kip. I told her I needed 1,000 baht, and when she quoted me 660,000 kip, that didn't seem a bad deal. As I was struggling to stay upright by now, 60,000 kip to be able to go and have some quality time with my toilet was money well spent.

So I agreed, and she went through her bags, displaying all kinds of currencies in various amounts. She really does offer a service.

And that's how I ended up getting the 1,000 baht I needed for my application.

## At the embassy

### Getting to the embassy

Beware that you want to go to the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/NA8WkqfJdKdYA2Xw6'>consular section of the Thai embassy</ExternalLink> in Vientiane. This is on Rue Bourichane, and is a bit of a distance away from other Thai embassy services, so make sure to go to the right place.

### Entering the embassy

As you approach the embassy you'll be hounded by people asking you if you need an application form. Ignore them. You get the application form for free from inside the embassy, and they are presumably the reason that it says 'This form is free of charge' in big, red writing at the top of the form.

If anyone asks you to pay for the form, you're speaking to the wrong person.

There is an unnecessarily big gate at the entrance to the embassy that will likely be closed. You need to go through the small pedestrian gate to the right of this and to the left of a blue sign. You needn't speak to anyone prior to going through this gate, so anyone who approaches you, ignore them.

Through this gate is a man in uniform sat at a table. The first thing he will ask to see is your appointment confirmation. He will check the details and will write the queue number on your application form. If you don't have an application form, he will give you a blank one, and will write your queue number of there.

He will check your other documents and if all are in order he will wave you through.

I'd read that bags are not allowed in the embassy. This is entirely false, there is no security check and bags are allowed into the embassy.

A sign at the entrance says 'No baggage allowed', but this presumably refers large items like suitcases and backpacks (some people will go straight from collecting their passport to the border). I had a rucksack and was allowed to take it in.

### Completing the application form

There are a couple of tables with pens on them to the right of the waiting area, where you can complete the application form. These also have some glue sticks to affix your photos to the form.

As immigration forms go, this one is pretty simple, but a couple of points to note:

For '**Proposed Address in Thailand**', if you don't have anywhere booked yet, then look-up a refundable hotel just across the border; perhaps in Nong Khai. That will allow you to firstly make a booking if the official asks for one, and get it refunded later, and secondly will justify why you don't have any inbound travel booked yet.

The '**Date of Arrival in Thailand**' field is pretty meaningless because your visa allows you to enter Thailand for up to three months after the date of application (not the date that you get your passport back) no matter what you enter here. Just make sure that if you have an outbound flight booked that it's not more than 60 days after this date.

For '**Travelling by**' I'd recommend entering '**Bus**'. I think it highly unlikely an official will ask for proof a bus ticket to get to Nong Khai, which is about six miles away.

For '**Duration of Stay in Thailand**', if you don't have defined dates yet, just enter '**60 days**'.

Then for '**Please indicate the type of visa requested**', tick '**Tourist**'. For '**Purpose of visit**' just enter '**Tourism**', and for '**Number of entries requested**' tick '**Single**' (multiple entry visas are only permitted for people living in Laos).

'**Name and Contact of Guarantor in Thailand**' and '**Name and Contact of Guarantor in Lao PDR**' can be left blank.

### Submitting the application

So you might think that being assigned a queue number when making your appointment would mean that there's a queue system in place and that you're called-up in order.

There's not, it's a free-for-all. There isn't even a ticket system of any kind once you're inside. People just sit on the front couple of rows of benches and slowly shuffle along as each person gets called up.

This was all fairly civil, although I had read some angry comments online about people from a particular country I won't name, pushing in front of everyone and just ignoring the fact there's a queue.

When I joined the queue there were around fifteen people in front of me. Initially only one official was processing applications, and as a couple of applicants took a long time, it was about 30 minutes until I went up.

By this time a second person was accepting applications so things were moving a bit quicker.

I went up and handed over my documents and my passport. The guy, sat behind some protective glass, rifled through the papers and said _"bank statements?"_

_"I don't have these,"_ I responded. Without saying another word, he looked at me like I'd insulted his mother, and literally threw it all back at me. It hit me in the chest.

Welcome to the land of smiles!

I was a bit annoyed by this reaction, and as a Thai visa was one of three or four options I was considering for the six weeks post-Laos that I wanted to stay in South-East Asia, I'd promised myself I wouldn't jump through any ridiculous hoops, like booking a flight I have no intention of taking, in order to obtain one. So I started home, before quickly changing my mind and figuring that, having got this far, printing some bank statements would be by far the least bureaucratic of my options.

I asked the guy at the desk where I do some printing, and he directed me to the left as I went out of the embassy.

About 20 yards down the road is a little sun-worn gazebo that has some printers and will take passport photos for you. I also saw a guy who hadn't brought any Thai baht with him leave the embassy and come back with 1,000 baht in about five minutes, so there's somewhere nearby to change money too.

That means that, apart from your passport, you can obtain all of the documents that you need in or around the embassy, but be warned, you'll have to pay for it.

A day prior to this I'd got three pages of my passport photocopies for 2,000 kip. Here I printed-off a seven-page bank statement and was charged 35,000 kip.

I went back into the embassy and joined the queue again. Some others who were sent away for documents came back and pushed to the front of the queue, and no one complained, but I thought this was a little unfair on the people waiting. My fear was that once I was at the front, I'd hand over my documents again, now including bank statement, and I'd be told to go away and come back with a flight, or a hotel booking.

Thankfully that didn't happen. With the bank statement, the documents were quickly accepted and I was given a receipt, with my queue number written on it, telling me to come back on the 9th of January (two working days later) between 1:30pm and 4pm:

> Visa must be collected on 09 Jan 2024 between 13:30 - 16:00 hours, otherwise it will be voided and returned to the holder.

Again encouraging applicants to enter the embassy no matter what infectious diseases they happen to be carrying, the threat is that they'll void your visa if you miss your collection window, which seems a little harsh.

To reiterate, the materials that were **required** for my application were:

- An application form
- Two passport-sized photos
- Passport
- A photocopy of my passport's information page
- A photocopy of my Laos visa
- A photocopy of my Laos entry stamp
- Three months of bank statements
- 1,000 baht

The materials that were **not required** were:

- A travel booking going into Thailand
- A travel booking out of Thailand
- A travel itinerary while in Thailand

## Collecting your visa

I arrived at the embassy at around 1:35pm to collect my passport on the 9th. While there were about twenty people ahead of me in the queue, it was no longer than three minutes until I was at the window.

You hand-over the receipt you were given when you submitted the application, and without even checking the details in the passport, they hand you the passport of the corresponding number (as well as a receipt for 1,000 baht).

This doesn't feel an entirely fool-proof system, so double-check that you have the right passport. And all being well, you'll have a shiny Thai tourist visa stuck inside.

The type of visa should say **'Tourist'**, the **'Valid from'** date should be the date that you applied, and the **'Valid until'** date should be three months after this (minus one day).

To clarify, this date range is not the dates that you are permitted to be in Thailand. The valid until date is the last day of which you can enter Thailand. No matter what date you enter, you will be permitted to stay in Thailand for 60 days.

## Should I get a visa or enter Thailand on a visa waiver?

A visa waiver permits you to stay in Thailand for 30 days. It is free, and once in Thailand it can be extended for a further 30 days (for 1,900 baht).

A Thailand tourist visa permits you to stay in Thailand for 60 days. It costs 1,000 baht (in Vientiane), and once in Thailand it can be extended for a further 30 days (for 1,900) baht.

### If you intend on being in Thailand for less than 30 days

Assuming you're from an eligible country, if you intend on being in Thailand for less than 30 days, enter on a visa waiver. Applying for a visa costs money and is a pain.

The only reason to get a pre-approved visa for a stay of less than 30 days is if you're worried about being rejected at the airport, and this is highly unlikely.

### If you plan on being in Thailand for 30 to 60 days

Your choice here is to either get a 60-day visa before entering Thailand, or enter Thailand on a 30-day visa waiver and extend this for 30 days.

Extensions within Thailand are a massive pain. You must apply at the immigration office of the province in which you are staying, and the requirements vary.

I've done such an extension in Chiang Mai, and it took six hours. I needed a TM30 form, which details your current accommodation and is submitted by your hotel. However the elderly owner of the new hotel I was staying at was too tech illiterate to do this online, so he had to come down to the embassy to do it in person, which took him all morning, just for me to be able to start my application.

I've also done the extension in Huahin, and they had no such requirement. It took less than 20 minutes from entering immigration before I walked out of there with an extension stamp in my passport, and was so easy that when I next needed an extension, I specifically went back to Huahin for a week.

I would say that if you're in Vientiane anyway, then the application process for a tourist visa is comparably easy compared to getting an extension whilst in Thailand, and it's 900 baht cheaper. So long as you have the time to wait for an appointment and be here for two working days while the visa is processed, it's the better option.

### If you plan on being in Thailand for 60 to 90 days

Aside from leaving and re-entering, as a tourist your only option is to get a 60-day visa prior to entering Thailand, and to extend it for 30 days once in the country.
