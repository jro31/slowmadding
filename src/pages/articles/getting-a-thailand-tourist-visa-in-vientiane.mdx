Visitors from many countries (including the US, UK, Australia and most of western Europe) can enter Thailand with no pre-approval on a 30 day tourist visa waiver.

For those who wish to stay as a tourist for longer there are two options:

- Enter Thailand on a 30 day tourist visa waiver and extend it for another 30 days once in the country
- Get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa before entering Thailand (this can also be extended for a further 30 days)

To get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa you're going to have to visit a Thai embassy, and the focus of this article is doing so in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

## How long does it take to get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane?

If, like me, you last went through this process in Vientiane prior to February 2019, then it may surprise you to learn that you now need to make an appointment at the embassy. In the past you could get a night-train from Bangkok to Nong Khai, cross the border to Laos, take a tuk-tuk straight to the embassy, join a (long) queue to apply for a visa, pick-up your passport the next day and go straight back to Thailand again.

For anyone planning on doing that today, I'll stress that this is no longer the case and you should plan on at least two weeks to complete the entire process, with a minimum of three working days needed in Vientiane.

I believe that doing the visa application in Savannakhet (southern Laos) you can still show up without an appointment and be approved within 24 hours. I haven't done this myself, so I cannot say with certainty.
