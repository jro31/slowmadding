Visitors from many countries (including the US, UK, Australia and most of western Europe) can enter Thailand with no pre-approval on a 30 day tourist visa waiver.

For those who wish to stay as a tourist for longer there are two options:

- Enter Thailand on a 30 day tourist visa waiver and extend it for another 30 days once in the country
- Get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa before entering Thailand (this can also be extended for a further 30 days)

To get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa you're going to have to visit a Thai embassy, and the focus of this article is doing so in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

## How long does it take to get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane?

If, like me, you last went through this process in Vientiane prior to February 2019, then it may surprise you to learn that you now need to make an appointment at the embassy. In the past you could get a night-train from Bangkok to Nong Khai, cross the border to Laos, take a tuk-tuk straight to the embassy, join a (long) queue to apply for a visa, pick-up your passport the next day and go straight back to Thailand again.

For anyone planning on doing that today, I'll stress that this is no longer the case and you should plan on at least two weeks to complete the entire process, with a minimum of three working days needed in Vientiane.

I believe that doing the visa application in Savannakhet (southern Laos) you can still show up without an appointment and be approved within 24 hours. I haven't done this myself, so I cannot say with certainty.

## Making an appointment

To get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane, the first step is to make an appointment at the consular section of the Thai embassy. You do that at <ExternalLink url='https://www.thaivisavientiane.com/'>thaivisavientiane.com</ExternalLink>.

Click 'Book your Appointment', and you'll have to click firstly through a warning, and then agree to some terms and conditions. These can be mostly ignored, although the one worth noting is:

> If you do not show for your scheduled appointment, there is a 30 day suspension rule for your account and if you cancel your appointment, we will impose a 10 day suspension for your account.

Ensuring that you show up at the embassy whether you have Covid or not, your account is suspended if you renege on your appointment. As your account is linked to your passport number, there is no option of just creating a new account if you get suspended, so be certain of your appointment time.

Agreeing to the terms and conditions page, you'll be taken to a page to 'Login to your Account'. As you don't have an account yet, click the 'Sign Up Now' link.

After agreeing that you won't input any inaccurate information, you'll be shown a 'Sign Up For New Applicant' form. This form requires your first name, middle name, last name, email address, contact number, passport number and nationality. Enter these and click 'Sign Up'.

If the sign-up is successful, you'll see an alert that says:

> Your new account is now registered
>
> Please log-in to your email account and verify your registration by using the username and password sent to your registered email address.

When I did this, I waited for around 30 minutes and no such email ever appeared. In concluding there had been an error, I tried to sign-up again, and this was the point that I found-out that I was blocked from re-registering, as my passport number had already been used.

What I instead had to do was to go back to the 'Login to your Account' page and click the 'Forgot your password Click here' link. This opens up a form to enter your email address and passport number. On submitting this form I did finally receive an email which included a password I could use to login with.

With that password, head back to the 'Login to your Account' screen, enter your email address, this password, and in the 'Security Code' input, just copy the code from above the input (or click on 'Copy Code' to enter it automatically). I've never seen such a futile attempt at security, but whatever floats your boat.

You should now be signed-into the app, at which point you'll see a list of available appointments, with unavailable days greyed-out.

At the time I did this on the 29th of December, the next available appointment was on the 5th of January, one week away. I've read online of people having to wait two weeks for the next appointment, hence why you should start the process a way in advance of needing the visa.

Click 'Book Appointment' on the available slot you desire, at which point you should be able to go to the 'My Appointment(s)' section where you will see the date and time of your appointment.

You will also receive an email confirming your appointment. This email will also contain other information such as your queue number, which is largely useless but in theory denotes your timeslot at the embassy. My queue number of 30 meant I was supposed to show-up between 9:30am and 10am.

I showed-up about 9:15am and no one cared, so I wouldn't pay much attention to it.

You will require this email in order to enter the embassy. Either printing it or showing it on your phone screen are sufficient.
