Visitors from many countries (including the US, UK, Australia and most of western Europe) can enter Thailand with no pre-approval on a 30 day tourist visa waiver.

For those who wish to stay as a tourist for longer there are two options:

- Enter Thailand on a 30 day tourist visa waiver and extend it for another 30 days once in the country
- Get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa before entering Thailand (this can also be extended for a further 30 days)

To get a 60 day Thailand tourist visa you're going to have to visit a Thai embassy, and the focus of this article is doing so in Vientiane, the capital of Laos.

## How long does it take to get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane?

If, like me, you last went through this process in Vientiane prior to February 2019, then it may surprise you to learn that you now need to make an appointment at the embassy. In the past you could get a night-train from Bangkok to Nong Khai, cross the border to Laos, take a tuk-tuk straight to the embassy, join a (long) queue to apply for a visa, pick-up your passport the next day and go straight back to Thailand again.

For anyone planning on doing that today, I'll stress that this is no longer the case and you should plan on at least two weeks to complete the entire process, with a minimum of three working days needed in Vientiane.

I believe that doing the visa application in Savannakhet (southern Laos) you can still show up without an appointment and be approved within 24 hours. I haven't done this myself, so I can't say with certainty.

## Making an appointment

To get a Thailand tourist visa in Vientiane, the first step is to make an appointment at the consular section of the Thai embassy. You do that at <ExternalLink url='https://www.thaivisavientiane.com/'>thaivisavientiane.com</ExternalLink>.

Click 'Book your Appointment', and you'll have to click firstly through a warning, and then agree to some terms and conditions. These can be mostly ignored, although the one worth noting is:

> If you do not show for your scheduled appointment, there is a 30 day suspension rule for your account and if you cancel your appointment, we will impose a 10 day suspension for your account.

Ensuring that you show up at the embassy whether you have Covid or not, your account is suspended if you renege on your appointment. As your account is linked to your passport number, there is no option of just creating a new account if you get suspended, so be certain of your appointment time.

Agreeing to the terms and conditions page, you'll be taken to a page to 'Login to your Account'. As you don't have an account yet, click the 'Sign Up Now' link.

After agreeing that you won't input any inaccurate information, you'll be shown a 'Sign Up For New Applicant' form. This form requires your first name, middle name, last name, email address, contact number, passport number and nationality. Enter these and click 'Sign Up'.

If the sign-up is successful, you'll see an alert that says:

> Your new account is now registered
>
> Please log-in to your email account and verify your registration by using the username and password sent to your registered email address.

When I did this, I waited for around 30 minutes and no such email ever appeared. In concluding there had been an error, I tried to sign-up again, and this was the point that I found-out that I was blocked from re-registering, as my passport number had already been used.

What I instead had to do was to go back to the 'Login to your Account' page and click the 'Forgot your password Click here' link. This opens up a form to enter your email address and passport number. On submitting this form I did finally receive an email which included a password I could use to login with.

With that password, head back to the 'Login to your Account' screen, enter your email address, this password, and in the 'Security Code' input, just copy the code from above the input (or click on 'Copy Code' to enter it automatically). I've never seen such a futile attempt at security, but whatever floats your boat.

You should now be signed-into the app, at which point you'll see a list of available appointments, with unavailable days greyed-out.

At the time I did this on the 29th of December, the next available appointment was on the 5th of January, one week away. I've read online of people having to wait two weeks for the next appointment, hence why you should start the process a way in advance of needing the visa.

Click 'Book Appointment' on the available slot you desire, at which point you should be able to go to the 'My Appointment(s)' section where you will see the date and time of your appointment.

You will also receive an email confirming your appointment. This email will also contain other information such as your queue number, which is largely useless but in theory denotes your timeslot at the embassy. My queue number of 30 meant I was supposed to show-up between 9:30am and 10am.

I showed-up about 9:15am and no one cared, so I wouldn't pay much attention to it.

You will require this email in order to enter the embassy. Either printing it or showing it on your phone screen are sufficient.

## Preparing for the appointment

I'd read conflicting information about whether I'd be able to print documents and exchange money at the embassy. Regardless, the more prepared I am and the less I have to do on the day, the less stressful it is, so I decided I'd get as much as I could done the day before my appointment.

### Required documents

The full list of officially required documents is as follows:

1. A completed application form
1. Two passport-sized photos, taken in the last 6 months
1. Your passport, valid for at least 6 months (it must have a blank page for the visa)
1. A photocopy of your passport's information page
1. A photocopy of your Laos visa
1. A photocopy of your Laos entry stamp
1. Three months of bank statements showing an average balance of 20,000 baht
1. Your travel booking going into Thailand
1. A travel booking out of Thailand (usually meaning an outbound flight)
1. Your travel itinerary while in Thailand (this can mean hotel bookings for your entire stay)

The list of actually required documents depends on the whim of the immigration official that day. Numbers 1 to 6 will be always be required. Numbers 7 to 10 are pot-luck.

Being asked for proof of travel into Thailand is unlikely, as being so close to the Thai border many people will just go themselves without any advanced booking. The application form includes a 'Proposed Address in Thailand' section, of which if you were to put somewhere near to the Laos border (Nong Khai or Udon Thani), then having advanced travel booked would be absurd.

In my various entries into Thailand over the years, I have never once had outbound travel booked. On the one occasion I was asked for it, I just said I planned on leaving by land, and that was enough to satisfy the border official.

If you have an outbound flight booked then obviously bring a copy of your booking. If you don't, because like me you don't plan two months in advance, then I'd suggest trying your luck without one. I've always managed.

Come up with a valid explanation for why you don't have an outbound flight, in case you get asked. For example you're going to travel by land to Malaysia. If that is unsuccessful then be prepared to pony-up for a flight ticket.

In that case, if you have an inkling of where you might go, then get a flight to your most likely destination, and if you really have no clue then get onto Skyscanner and get the cheapest flight you can find. It just has to be a flight from anywhere in Thailand, to anywhere outside Thailand, within 60 days of what you've written as your date of arrival in Thailand on your application form.

You can almost always find a flight for less than 1,300 baht.

Being asked to prove your entire travel itinerary within Thailand is unlikely. More common is they'll want to see evidence if your first accommodation. If you don't have anywhere booked yet then be ready to jump on booking.com or Agoda. Many hotels offer refundable bookings, so you can make a booking, print it out, and cancel it right after, although beware that the address of the booking you print-out must match the 'Proposed Address in Thailand' answer that you gave on the application form.

Prior to this application I'd never been asked to prove my finances, but on this occasion I was. More on that below.

### Gathering documents

If you arrive at the embassy without a completed application form, they will give you one free of charge and there is a table with pens to complete it. It is not necessary to complete before arriving at the embassy.

If you do want to print and complete it before going to the embassy then it can be downloaded from <ExternalLink url='https://www.thaivisavientiane.com/'>thaivisavientiane.com</ExternalLink> (the same site used to make the appointment) by clicking 'Download Application Form'.

There are many places around Vientiane to print documents and make copies. Many of these can also take and print passport photographs. I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/za5jiiyDVZnYKvR26'>Idea Copy Center</ExternalLink>. I already had two photographs and didn't have to make any print-outs, so just needed the three relevant pages of my passport photocopied. For this I was charged 2,000 kip.

They can also do print-outs and passport photographs here. The woman working here was very friendly and spoke good English.

### Getting baht

Applying for a Thai visa in Vientiane costs 1,000 baht. You can only pay in baht; dollars are not accepted, kip is not accepted.

If you're coming to Vientiane from Thailand and you know in advance that you'll be doing a visa application, then I strongly suggest bringing 1,000 baht with you. I wish I had.

If you wander around Vientiane, you see currency exchanges everywhere. Most banks advertise as exchanging currency. As I found out the hard way, they only exchange from foreign currencies into kip, not the other way around. Presumably the government doesn't allow it.

I went to nine different exchanges, including the cluster of Thai banks that peculiarly sits in Vientiane, and asked if I could exchange kip to baht. At each one I was told no, and at each one I asked where I could do this. No one knew.

The collective brilliance of Thailand requiring visa fees in Laos to be paid in baht, with Laos simultaneously not allowing exchange to baht, really is some next-level ineptitude.

I'd somehow given myself food poisoning on this day, and spent all morning throwing up. Wandering around in the Vientiane heat hungry, dehydrated, and trying not to shit myself was not my idea of fun. I was about to give up and go back to my room, but decided to try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/d6qCJtAFhDY5WN4R6'>one more exchange</ExternalLink> that was showing up on Google Maps, where the most recent reviews mentioned that the exchange is no longer there, but there's a woman who sits nearby and approaches foreigners asking if they want to exchange cash.

I didn't really think that would be the most reliable service, but I was close by so I walked down, and sure enough, right before I got to where this currency exchange was according to Google Maps, a woman saw me and shouted "exchange".

I wouldn't normally advise exchanging money with random people in the street, but the reviews I'd seen all read very positively, and I was kind of at the end of my rope by this point.

I already knew that the official rate was 1,000 baht = 600,000 kip. I told her I needed 1,000 baht, and when she quoted me 660,000 kip, that didn't seem a bad deal. As I was struggling to stay upright by now, 60,000 kip to be able to go and have some quality time with my toilet was money well spent.

So I agreed, and she went through her bags, displaying all kinds of currencies in various amounts. She really does offer a service.

And that's how I ended up getting the 1,000 baht I needed for my application.
