Welcome to my new favourite place in the world. Fuck you Siem Reap!

I had loved absolutely everything about being a digital nomad up to the point I came to Udon Thani. The seven months prior had given me the most consistent happiness I've known in my life, but within that context I arrived in Udon Thani feeling as down as I had done at any other point as a digital nomad, because I'd firstly injured my ankle, then got sick, then had a really bad hangover after Songkran (alright, I can't really complain about that one). I derive a lot of my happiness from being mobile and active, and when that is inhibited, it can test the resolve of my smile, so arriving in Udon I needed a little boost.

That's exactly what I got.

It's one of the big four cities in Thailand's Isaan region; a region representing about a third of the Thai population, but like anywhere that's not Bangkok, Chiang Mai or the beaches, it basically gets ignored by tourists. That can either be a very good thing or a very bad thing, and you don't really find out which until you get here.

I knew very little prior to coming here, but was dubious when in the departure lounge for my flight from Bangkok, I spotted four overweight, balding, middle-aged white men, each by themselves sipping a can of beer.

It wasn't even 11am.

The reason that's a concern is Thailand's worst kept secret, the existence of which is continually denied by officials, is its sex tourism. Congregations of balding white men drinking beer in the morning is usually a good indication of that, and seeing four of them in the departure lounge for my flight did make me question what kind of place I was going to. Luckily that fear was misplaced.

I got off the plane, checked-into my room, and wandered around town for several hours without seeing another foreigner. It was an amazingly friendly place. Lots of people came up and talked to me, and everyone just seemed genuinely happy. It was only on inadvertently wandering down Samphan Thamit Alley, ironically nearby to the Pervy clinic, that I was all... _"oh, this is where all the foriengers are."_

There's literally one road (and surrounding area) of bars, and that seems to be where all of the overweight white men spend their time. They're confined to this area, and the rest of the city's lovely.

## Where I stayed

### Jamjuree Home

<AccommodationTable details={jamjureeHomeDetails} />

The most important thing when you go somewhere is booking the right accommodation. If you're like me and you work from your room, then you're going to be spending a lot of time there, so you need to get it right. And boy did I?

Jamjuree Home is more a homestay than a hotel, although the guests have a segregated area which consists of four rooms and a large, two-floor common area. Udon Thani is a non-touristy city, and I was here in the low season of a post-covid world. That meant for much of my stay I was the only guest. I arrived here having booked a standard bedroom, but the hotel owner, who's one of the sweetest people I've ever met, offered to upgrade me to the family studio that you see in the details above at no extra charge.

I'd say that calling it a studio is being modest. The bedroom is separated from the kitchen by a wall. Surely that makes it a one bedroom. Semantics aside, it's a really, really lovely place.

As well as the owner, there's one member of staff, and they are amazingly considerate. They make an effort to clean the room at times you're out, and at one point I mentioned to the owner that I was going to Loei after Udon, and asked if she knew anything about how/where to get the bus there. She didn't.

Yet, not only did she come back ten minutes later having called around the bus companies and written down for me the bus times, but on the day I checked-out, a week or so later, she did the exact same thing again. All from an off-the-cuff comment I made one day.

Breakfast is included, and this was possibly the highlight for me. When I checked-in the owner asked me about breakfast, and on telling her I was vegan there was no hesitation in saying what food she'd be able to prepare. I never had to mention it again, and each morning she made me a breakfast that consisted of a vegan potato and mushroom soup, a salad, some fruit, a vegan cake, and the fanciest pot of green tea I've ever had.

Having grown tired of the shitty or non-existent cups that hotels provide, by this stage of being a digital nomad I'd bought my own cup that I carried around in my suitcase. As I'd often be staying in rooms with nothing more than a hand towel, I never really cleaned it properly. It was turning green.

Whilst staying here I'd wake up in the morning, have a cup of green tea out of my dirty travel mug, then go down to breakfast and be served the most beautiful pot of green tea you can imagine. It'd be in a glass pot with a glass lid on a glass stand with a glass cup and a glass saucer, and one of those things that you pour the tea through to filter it, which itself has a stand, and its stand has a stand. Prior to staying here, if a tea bag had a string on it I'd think it was posh. I have the same rule for tampons. This took it to a whole other level.

Breakfast was served from 8am to 10:30am each day. Having got into the habit of not eating until lunch prior to coming here, I'd come down at 10:29 after doing my morning yoga, and it was really the perfect way to start the day.

The room was so comfortable, and pretty spacious for what I'm used to. It includes a balcony and a sort of kitchen. No cooking facilities other than a microwave, but a large fridge, a sink, a hot water dispenser and some plates and cutlery, as well as a small table with a couple of chairs.

The common area is huge, especially considering I was the only guest most of the time, and has many other sofas/chairs to sit on, and another balcony. The one downside is this isn't air conditioned, so got pretty hot during the daytime, although they did give me a far for when I was sitting out here coding one day, which made it bearable. The property also has a nice garden which includes some seating.

This is also the smoking area, so if you're staying here and you're not the only guest, it might not be so pleasant. As I was, I found it a great place to sit and wait until I'd stopped sweating before going up to my room after a run.

This alone would make this an amazing place to stay, but perhaps the best thing about Jamjuree Home is the location. You're about a 30-minute walk from the city centre, which puts you in a more local, slightly quieter area, but it's a comfortable walk in for when you do go into town. You have a couple of local 'jay' (vegan) restaurants nearby, as well as a 7-11 and some other convenience stores, and I went to the nearby <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/H1NSMQvBwVb25u6NA'>Fit Gym</ExternalLink> three times during my stay, which is a huge, well-equipped but not very well attended gym that costs just 160 baht for a day pass. The crown jewel of Udon Thani though, is Nong Prajak Park, which is just a short walk from Jamjuree Home.

Nong Prajak Park is more a lake than a park, but it has a cycle path and separated running track all the way around its 3.1km circumference. It's the perfect place to come for a run or a walk when you need exercise, or it's nice to just come and sit by the water. Having it so nearby is the cherry on top.

## Where to get vegan food in Udon Thani

If there's one criticism I could level at Udon Thani, this would be it. While there is _some_ vegan food available here, it lacks in variety.

I love Thai food as much as the next man. That's a lie, I think Thai food's very overrated, but Thai people get upset when I say that. It's something that I like to eat sometimes. It's not something that I like to eat for every meal.

Well what I found in Udon, is that there's only really one restaurant for non-Thai vegan food: Primani's.

### Primani's

Because this was the only place I found in Udon to get non-Thai vegan food, I ate here more than the quality justifies, including getting delivery off FoodPanda a couple of times. That doesn't mean it's a bad place, but it probably won't blow you away either.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is definitely curious. It feels kind of like eating in a library, and despite music playing I'd see people come in and start whispering to each other. I'm not sure how they managed that.

The menu consists of four curries that are natively vegan, and one more that can be made vegan. These aren't marked on the menu, but the owner speaks fluent English and understands what vegan means, so just ask about anything you're unsure of. The quality is decent, and you can expect to pay around 250 baht for a curry, some rice, a chapati and a bottle of water.

### Zing Zing Che

Being the closest vegan restaurant to where I was staying, I came here a few times. It's a typical point-and-hope local family run 'jay' restaurant, although they also have a menu on the wall that's translated into English.

No one here speaks a word of English, but you can get by pointing at the buffet if you lack the Thai to communicate. As always with this kind of place, the buffet's a bit hit-and-miss. Some things on offer tasted amazing, others less so, but it's very cheap, so you can afford a few misses.

Entirely unrelated to Zing Zing Che, but often located very nearby is a vegan dessert vendor selling some deep fried goodies. I got a plateful of desserts from her for 35 baht, so I definitely recommend paying here a visit if she's around when you come here.

### Maeya

I didn't really like Maeya, of which you may be thinking _"well why are you including it in your recommended restaurants then?"_ And that is a good question.

It's because it's easy.

Unlike other restaurnts in Udon, it's reliably open at the times it's supposed to be, the menu is translated into English, and vegan options are clearly marked. So when you want to go somewhere, know exactly what you're ordering, and be able to just point at the menu, this is it.

It's a bit of a mill, in that they just churn-out food with little regard for the experience or the service. What I mean is that one person takes your order, another brings you one dish, another the next, someone else the bill etc. It's not personal. Someone will put a plate down in front of you without saying much, and you'll never see them again.

You don't come here to talk, you come here to eat, and the food is mostly good. I got one dish (vegan fried wanton in gravy sauce) that was absolutely foul, mainly because the gravy was this horrible gloop that felt and tasted nothing like what I think of gravy as. Everything else was decent.

It's the kind of restaurant where, were I in a place of vegan abundance like Bangkok, I wouldn't give it a second look. As it is, I came here multiple times just because of how barren Udon is for vegans.

## Where to run in Udon Thani

I saw other places that looked viable for running in Udon, but none as good as Nong Prajak Park, and as I was staying so nearby, this is where I went for all five of my runs here.

It's a lake with a 3.1km circumference that has a running track and separated cycling track all the way around it. In the evenings it gets quite crowded, but come here in the daytime and you'll have the whole thing to yourself. It got consistently to 40°C at lunchtime while I was here, and for some reason other people don't like running then, so if you enjoy saunas and want to work on your tan at the same time, it's perfect.

You don't get much shade. I'd arrived here was a bad ankle and a fever, and running with no shade on a bad ankle with a fever in 40°C is a great way to test your mettle and find out what you're made of.

Turns out I'm not made of very much as I only made it two laps, but it's still an absolutely lovely place to run. I would highly recommend finding somewhere to stay that's nearby when coming to Udon. Definitely the highlight of the city for me.

<ImageGallery images={runningImages} />

## Being sociable in Udon Thani

I found no pre-organised events to attend in Udon, so if you're here alone and you want to go out, you're more or less limited to wandering to the town centre and finding a bar. I did that twice and had a surprising amount of fun.

What I realised is that some people I'd met on that first night out, I also saw in completely separate bars on that second night out. There's a community of expats in Udon, presumably who're married to locals (I know that's the case for some that I met), who go around all the bars and drink everyday.

The only bars I found were all on or around Samphan Thamit Alley, which is a fairly long road lined with bars with one complex of even more bars at the north end, and another complex a short walk from the south end.

These bars are aimed entirely at foreigners, so many have hostesses, but there are normal bars. Most close at midnight but as I found the hard way, if you wander around this area you'll be able to find somewhere that'll serve you alcohol for as long as you can keep drinking it.

That's the hangover sorted.
