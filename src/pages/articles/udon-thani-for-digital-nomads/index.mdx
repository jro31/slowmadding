## Where I stayed

### Jamjuree Home

<AccommodationTable details={jamjureeHomeDetails} />

The first thing to say is that on Agoda I booked a standard bedroom. It was on arrival at the property that [host's name], the hotel's owner offered to upgrade me for free to a family studio because I was going to be staying so long. I don't think you'll be able to find a studio for the price I paid prior to arrival.

That in itself is a good summary of this hotel; I absolutely loved it...
