Welcome to my new favourite place in the world. Fuck you Siem Reap!

To understand why I loved it here so much, you have to understand the mindset that I came here with. If you're not someone that likes long, boring stories and you just want to get into the meat and bones of Udon Thani, I suggest you [skip this section](#). [ADD LINK]

Oh, you're still here. Well then let's take a journey.

## Where I stayed

### Jamjuree Home

<AccommodationTable details={jamjureeHomeDetails} />

The first thing to say is that on Agoda I booked a standard bedroom. It was on arrival at the property that [host's name], the hotel's owner offered to upgrade me for free to a family studio because I was going to be staying so long. I don't think you'll be able to find a studio for the price I paid prior to arrival.

That in itself is a good summary of this hotel; I absolutely loved it...
