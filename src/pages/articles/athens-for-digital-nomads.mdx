An oven, microwave, four hobs, loads of pots, pans, cuttlery, crockery and cooking utensils, a large fridge-freezer, and even a washing machine. The surface and chairs on the bottom-right of the picture are great for cooking, eating and working, especially with a couple of easy-access plugs. The one downside is that the nearest air-conditioner is in the bedroom, which doesn't really reach into the kitchen, so on hot days it's not the best place to work.",

If you want someone to like you, you shouldn't set the bar too high at the beginning. In my experience of people, it's the ones that I immediately like that usually end up being a bit of a dick, where as the ones I don't take to, I become friends with over the long-term.

That's the strategy adopted by Athens. For my first couple of days I really regretted coming here, after which I fell in love with it and stayed far longer than I originally planned.
