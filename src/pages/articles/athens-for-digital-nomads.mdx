If you want someone to like you, you shouldn't set the bar too high at the beginning. In my experience of people, it's the ones that I immediately like that usually end up being a bit of a dick, where as the ones I don't take to, I become friends with over the long-term.

That's the strategy adopted by Athens. For my first couple of days I really regretted coming here, after which I fell in love with it and stayed far longer than I originally planned.

## Where I stayed

### Near Acropolis bright apartment! Next to Metro

<AccommodationAddress name='Eggeli 68' url='https://goo.gl/maps/nCAzLD6TbGTsS9v88' />

<AccommodationTable details={neosKosmosApartmentDetails} />

In keeping with the Athenian tradition of setting the bar really low so that things can only better, my stay here started terribly, but it grew into one of my favourite places that I've stayed.

It was the first and only place I stayed that wasn't self check-in during this trip to Europe. I got off the plane from Sofia and neither my UK nor my Bulgarian network would connect, so instead I instead used the airport wifi and messaged the hosts saying I was leaving the airport, so would be at the room soon. I was assured that someone would be there to meet me.

I arrived. No one was there to meet me.

Without any network, I couldn't message anyone so had to wait until someone else came into the building. I snuck-in after them while the door was open, went up to the third floor, and from there I was able to catch the apartment's wifi connection, so I again messaged and said _"I'm here, no one's here to meet me."_

_"They'll be there shortly_" was the reply.

I went up to the fourth floor, being told that was the floor the apartment was on, and I sat in the stairwell waiting for someone to show up.

Ten minutes pass. No one shows up. Fifteen minutes pass. No one shows up. Twenty minutes pass, and finally the door to one of the apartments opens. The person I was supposed to be meeting was inside the apartment but, as he said, hadn't been checking his messages. Great. So I'd been sitting in the hallway like a muppet, with him right on the other side of the door.

He'd been expecting me to ring the doorbell, but this is a building with many apartments, and no one had told me which apartment it was or which doorbell to ring, so that was well organised.

He quickly showed me around, telling me absolutely nothing that I couldn't have figured-out myself hence this in-person check-in was a bit ludicrous, but finally, more than thirty minutes after arriving at the building, I was in my room.

My first impression was... well there's not much stuff. What I mean is that often hosts will leave you food, or at least some cooking essentials like oil. Nope, none of that. There's a washing machine in the room, so surely there's some detergent somewhere? Nope, none of that either, nor any shampoo, there was only two rolls of toilet paper for my six-week stay, one of the AC remotes had no batteries, and the kettle was partially broken. So one of the first things I did after checking-in was go down to the nearby Lidl and buy all the stuff that a thoughtful host provides, none of which were included here. Well, things can only get better.

I'm a pretty low-maintenance guest, but after the shambles that was this check-in process, the company that manages this apartment (they manage several Airbnbs in Greece) were really top-notch. The kettle fully broke about a week later, and someone showed-up on a motorcycle to replace it within 24 hours. Someone called 'Eirini', who was my point of contact, was always so friendly. The wifi speeds in the room are pretty dire, and I messaged Eirini to ask if this was normal. Knowing full well she was going to do nothing about it, she replied saying _"I'll contact the network and see what they can do about it."_ The whole conversation was so cordial, I couldn't really be angry that she was only pretending she was going to try and fix it.

Predictably the speeds didn't improve, so for the duration of my stay the download speed hovered around 6mbps, and the upload speed was about 0.6mbps. For context, the upload speed when I'd been in Bucharest was around 550mbps (917 times faster), so I was surprised to find that I could actually do video calls on this connection. I have my doubts it would be good enough if other people were simultaneously connected, but that's another check in the column for loneliness.

I really liked the room though. In Sofia I'd stayed somewhere with a lack of natural light, so I absolutely loved how much light got-in here. It was such a bright apartment, and very spacious. Moving-out the coffee table, there was a huge floor space in the living room that I used most mornings for exercise. The only downside of this room being so big, was the TV was tiny, and it was miles away on the other side of the room. You could have a 60" TV in there and it wouldn't have looked out of place.

The only room that did feel a little lacking in quality was the bathroom. It's a pretty drab bathroom, but I guess it stops me sitting on the toilet for too long. Every other room was great.

The kitchen was equipped with everything you'd expect it to be, and included a counter with a couple of stools I would eat at and that was the best place to set-up a workstation. The only downside was there are two air conditioners in the apartment; one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Neither really reach the kitchen, so on very hot days it could be a bit much to work in there.

I'm never above working from my bed, and the bedroom is basic but very pleasant. Lots of natural light, lots of storage space and comfortable. The sofa in the living room was the other place I worked, but the downside is there are no plugs nearby, so anytime I did I was at the mercy of my laptop's battery.

The apartment is a short was from Neos Kosmos metro station, and I absolutely fell in love with the area. It's not at all touristy, is very peaceful, but everything you need is within easy reach.

Lidl is about a five-minute walk, and other supermarkets are a bit further. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to Koukaki, which is a much more lively (and touristy) area not far from the Acropolis with loads of restaurants. Nea Smyrni park is a good place to run or to go for a walk, and is less than twenty minutes walking from the room. For anything else, as well as the metro, there's a tram stop less than five minutes away, so it's a lovely area.

After such a shitty start, I was really sad when I had to leave this place. It's a really great room, I hope to stay again in future.
