If you want someone to like you, you shouldn't set the bar too high at the beginning. In my experience of people, it's the ones that I immediately like that usually end up being dickheads, where as the ones I don't take to, I become friends with over the long-term.

That's the strategy adopted by Athens. For my first couple of days I really regretted coming here, after which I fell in love with it and stayed far longer than I originally planned.

The reason for this gradual adoration was that coming from Bulgaria, and before it Romania, I found Athens to be twice as expensive and half as developed as those countries. You'll find a very noticeable hike in prices making the same journey, but in simple things like taking the metro, you still can't scan your debit card at the ticket gate and instead have to buy a paper ticket like some kind of explorer from the 1800s.

Once you've embraced those initial frustrations, they become part of the seduction of Athens, a place very agreeable in its character. The right mix of spirit and poise where you can be at ease in the thrill.

Perhaps the greatest asset to a digital nomad in Athens is the readiness of a social life. Partly that's down to the number of organised events, but more, people here are just very willing to meet others and I've rarely felt so immediately welcomed. The digital nomad life can be a lonely life, but here above anywhere else I've been, I found myself building lasting relationships. Were it not for the coming winter that marked the conclusion of my time, I would have gladly stayed in Athens indefinitely. Yet even in just the weeks I was here, it became my favourite place west of Bangkok.

As long as your budget stretches as such that you can be comfortable, Athens should be at the top of your wishlist for the region.

In keeping with the Athenian tradition of setting the bar really low so that things can only better, my stay here started terribly, but it grew into one of my favourite places that I've stayed.

It was the first and only place I stayed that wasn't self check-in during this stint in Europe. I got off the plane from Sofia and neither my UK nor my Bulgarian networks would connect, so instead I instead used the airport wifi and messaged the hosts saying I was leaving the airport, so would be at the room soon. I was assured that someone would be there to meet me.

I arrived. No one was there to meet me.

Without any network I couldn't message anyone so had to wait until a resident came into the building. I snuck-in after them while the door was open, went up to the third floor, and from there I was able to catch the apartment's wifi connection, so I again messaged and said _"I'm here, no one's here to meet me."_

_"They'll be there shortly_" was the reply.

I went up to the fourth floor, being told that was the floor the apartment was on, and I sat in the stairwell waiting for someone to show up.

Ten minutes pass. No one shows up. Fifteen minutes pass. No one shows up. Twenty minutes pass, and finally the door to one of the apartments opens. The person I was supposed to be meeting was inside the apartment but, as he said, hadn't been checking his messages. Great. So I'd been sitting in the hallway like a muppet, with him right on the other side of the door.

He'd been expecting me to ring the doorbell, but this is a building with many apartments, and no one had told me which apartment it was or which doorbell to ring, so that was well organised.

He quickly showed me around, telling me absolutely nothing that I couldn't have figured-out myself hence this in-person check-in being a bit ludicrous, but finally, more than thirty minutes after arriving at the building, I was in my room.

My first impression was... well there's not much stuff. What I mean is that often hosts will leave you food, or at least some cooking essentials like oil. Nope, none of that. There's a washing machine in the room, so surely there's some detergent somewhere? Nope, none of that either, nor any shampoo, there was only two rolls of toilet paper for my six-week stay, one of the AC remotes had no batteries, and the kettle was partially broken. So one of the first things I did after checking-in was go down to the nearby Lidl and buy all the stuff that thoughtful hosts provide. Well, things can only get better.

I'm a pretty low-maintenance guest, but after the shambles that was this check-in process, the company that manages this apartment (they manage several Airbnbs in Greece) were really top-notch. The kettle fully broke about a week later, and someone showed-up on a motorcycle to replace it within 24 hours. Someone called 'Eirini', who was my point of contact, was always very friendly. The wifi speeds in the room are pretty dire, and I messaged Eirini to ask if this was normal. Knowing full well she was going to do nothing about it, she replied saying _"I'll contact the network and see what they can do about it."_ The whole conversation was so cordial I couldn't really be angry that she was only pretending she was going to try and fix it.

Predictably the speeds didn't improve, so for the duration of my stay the download speed hovered around 6mbps, and the upload speed was about 0.6mbps. For context, the upload speed when I'd been in Bucharest was around 550mbps (917 times faster), so I was surprised to find that I could actually do video calls on this connection. I have my doubts it would be good enough if other people were simultaneously connected, but that's another check in the column for loneliness.

I really liked the room though. In Sofia I'd stayed somewhere with a lack of natural light, so I absolutely loved how much light got-in here. It was such a bright apartment, and very spacious. Moving-out the coffee table, there was a huge floor space in the living room that I used most mornings for exercise. The only downside of this room being so big, was the TV was tiny and it was miles away on the other side of the room. You could have a 60" TV in there and it wouldn't look out of place.

The only room that did feel a little lacking in quality was the bathroom. It's a pretty drab bathroom, but I guess it stops me sitting on the toilet for too long. Every other room was great.

The kitchen is equipped with everything you'd expect it to be, and includes a counter with a couple of stools I would eat at, and that was also the best place to set-up a workstation. The only downside was there are two air conditioners in the apartment; one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Neither really reach the kitchen, so on very hot days it could be a bit much to work there.

I'm never above working from my bed, and the bedroom is basic but very pleasant. Lots of natural light, lots of storage space and comfortable. The sofa in the living room was the other place I worked, but the downside is there are no plugs nearby, so anytime I did I was at the mercy of my laptop's battery.

The apartment is a short walk from Neos Kosmos metro station, and I absolutely fell in love with the area. It's not at all touristy, is very peaceful, but everything you need is within easy reach.

Lidl is about a five-minute walk, with other supermarkets are a bit further. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to Koukaki, which is a much more lively (and touristy) area not far from the Acropolis with loads of restaurants. Nea Smyrni park is a good place to run or to go for a walk, and is less than twenty minutes walking from the room. For anything else, as well as the metro there's a tram stop less than five minutes away, so it's a lovely area.

After such a shitty start, I was really sad when I had to leave this place. It's a really great room; I hope to stay again in future.

### Cozy & Elegant Flat w/ Balcony, 10' from Acropolis

<AccommodationTable details={koukakiApartmentDetails} />

Under other circumstances, this isn't a room I'd have chosen to stay in, but as there was a high possibility I'd have a friend staying with me, I went for a place in a busier area than I'd usually stay, with looser financial restrictions in order to get somewhere bigger, so it would be comfortable for two.

Despite a different genus to my usual room, I really liked this place.

Of course it took a little time getting comfortable, this is Athens after all. I have a fairly high noise tolerance, but being on a busy road took me a couple of days to adjust to. In the photos on Airbnb, I'd seen that there was a little lip on the bed frame that would stop your feet from hanging-off the end. I took this to mean that the bed would be long enough that wasn't necessary, but it turns out it's actually quite a small bed. I'm six-foot on a good day, and it took me a little while to get used to sleeping where I couldn't stretch all the way out. I'm not sure who came up with that idea for a bed frame.

In my experience, with a day or two you can adjust to sleeping anywhere, and once I had I really did enjoy staying here. It's a pretty big place for a one-bedroom flat. The bedroom, kitchen and living room are all a decent size. The bedroom includes a desk and comfortable chair to set-up a good workspace, the kitchen includes a dining table and four chairs but still feels spacious, and the living room has a sofa which (I think) opens into a second bed, and it also includes an armchair which I found comfortable to work from. There's a decent-sized TV, albeit on a very rickety entertainment unit that I felt could collapse at any minute (to the point I removed all the books to alleviate the weight it was carrying).

The flat has very high ceilings. I couldn't reach them if I tried, so my one grievance was that in each room, the light hangs down from the ceiling about a metre. In the kitchen and the bedroom that didn't concern me, but in the living room, where I did yoga and other exercise, it was a pain because I'd keep on punching the light while I was working-out. If you've got high ceilings, why make them lower by dangling a light down?

The kitchen is equipped with everything you'd expect, barring a microwave which was a bit annoying. The bedroom has loads of storage space, and even though the bathtub isn't big enough for anyone but a midget to bathe in, the bathroom is perfectly adequate.

The Internet was fast and reliable, with the exception of when there was a Vodafone-wide outage for the entire local area for two days. The host was very good at checking this for me and keeping me informed of any updates. Perhaps my favourite feature of this apartment though, is the balcony.

Unlike in my previous room, it has a table and chairs out there as a permanent fixture, so I would come onto the balcony with a cup of tea most mornings and watch the world go by. A tree partially obscures the view, but being on a busy road, there's still enough going on to make sitting outside a pleasant start to everyday.

I wouldn't quite describe the area as touristy; it's not as bad here as in the town centre. What I would say is it's bustling with a combination of locals and tourists, and there are loads of restaurants (many with vegan options) and a couple of supermarkets within a very easy walk.

The road behind the room turns into a local market every Friday and is a great place to buy fresh produce, and a five-minute walk up the hill behind the property takes you to Philopappos Hill, which is a fairly pleasant park to come to if you need some exercise or want to get outside for a bit.

If money was of no object, I'd gladly stay here again. It's a very nice room once you're used to the ridiculous bed.

## Where to get vegan food in Athens

I'm typically a regular at my local vegan restaurants when I go somewhere, but a combination of the cost of accommodation in Athens, the quality of the kitchens that I had, and the distance of vegan restaurants from my first room, meant that here I made most of my meals for myself, like a peasant.

That isn't to say that Athens is a hard city to be vegan in if you don't have a kitchen, it's really not. There are vegan, or otherwise vegan-friendly restaurants dotted all over the central parts of the city, so explore the area local to where you're staying and you're almost certain to find something. When you venture farther from the city centre they become a little more sparse, but it's certainly not a hard city to be vegan.

### Peas

The closest thing I had to a regular vegan restaurant in Athens was Peas. This was definitely my favourite place. It's located in Koukaki and offers all kinds of meat-dish equivalents, but not trying to make them so realistic that it comes at the sacrifice of taste or health.

Included on the menu are three kinds of burgers, a club sandwich made from seitan, kebab slices made from lentils and chickpeas and perhaps my favourite dish is the 'zen palette', which includes tempeh, tofu and seitan. A great post-workout meal I'm sure.

The most expensive items on the menu are €11.50, but they have many that are cheaper. They also have free water readily available and don't pressure you at all to buy a drink, so the menu price of the food is what you end up paying.

If there's one downside, it's that there aren't many tables so if you come here at a busy time you might not have anywhere to sit. I was always able to get somewhere, but they do offer take-away as an alternative.

Because of how readily-available vegan food is in Athens, I wouldn't really recommend travelling for food, but if there is one place that's worth travelling for, it's this one.

### Bread Factory

In a city plentiful with vegan restaurants, Bread Factory might seem a strange choice to include in my vegan recommendations for Athens, but the reason I include it is I found it incredibly convenient and stocking the kinds of items that were hard to find elsewhere.

To start with the convenience, it's open 24 hours per day so no matter what time of night you get peckish, you never have to go hungry. In that sense it's great for drunk food, although it often astounded me how many non-drunk people would come here to sit quietly with a hot drink in the dead of night while I was stumbling home. Beyond that, everything in the shop is clearly labelled, with all vegan items having a 'vegan' icon attached to them, so you can really easily identify what you can eat here; again useful when drunk.

And while the name may imply that it's an industrial bakery, it offers much more than that. I like to make my daily smoothies with seeds, and they have some very reasonably-priced here, including chia seeds and flax seeds, which aren't too easy to find elsewhere in Athens. It has vegan ice cream, and plenty of vegan snacky food that you can put on the table for when you get peckish. Things like vegan cookies and sweets aren't so easily available elsewhere. They also sell hot food, including vegan burgers for just €2.98, which is where it becomes great for you post-drinking meander home.

I'll stress that it's not a place that you should travel far to visit, there's little here to blow your mind. But if you're staying nearby, it might surprise you how many useful items that are hard to find elsewhere are stocked here, each clearly labelled as vegan, and available 24 hours per day.

### Supermarkets

Given how vegan-friendly the restaurant-scene is in Athens, supermarkets leave a little to be desired. For some reason every supermarket, even smaller ones, have vegan cheese. Beyond that, most don't have any dedicated vegan sections, just a few unintentionally vegan items dotted around the store.

For example, I did the majority of my shopping at Lidl, where you can buy wholewheat pasta, hummus, vegan cheese and corn to make my world famous hummus pasta. Or you can buy wholewheat tortilla wraps, hummus, salad, corn, kidney beans, olives and vegan cheese for my world famous tortilla wraps. Many of the bread items in the supermarkets are vegan, and you'll find some vegan pasta sauces, other things like gnocchi that can be turned-into a meal, some vegan muesli with many plant-based milks, and even the occasional vegan instant meal (Lidl sells a pre-made vegan moussaka).

Combine that with the usual fruits and vegetables and you won't go hungry shopping in the supermarkets in Athens, but compared to places I've been previously (I'm thinking particularly of Bucharest), the supermarkets in Athens aren't overly vegan-friendly. The vegan food they have is mostly vegan by accident.

## Where to run in Athens

Athens doesn't believe in flat surfaces. Anytime you go somewhere, you're either going up hill or down hill. It also doesn't believe in smooth paving. They built this city 3,000 years ago and just thought fuck it, this'll do, and haven't touched it since.

That brings some charm, but when it comes to running you need to accept that you're going to be running up hill a lot, and you need to pay attention to where you're stepping, lest your ankle become less connected. That's not to say that this is a bad place to run, I actually found some really pleasant routes, but do temper your expectations.

The other bad news is that, unlike other cities in Europe, there aren't many parks in Athens and the ones that are here are pretty small. The good news is that if you get away from the main roads, it can be a pleasant city to just run around, so don't limit yourself to running in parks while you're here.

My favourite place to run was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WcAvcoxCxhqQbmCUA'>Nea Smyrni park</ExternalLink>. It's a small park, built on a hill surprisingly, with a pretty uneven path that goes around the outside. Yes, this is what you're playing with here. One lap is just under 800m so for a 5k run you need close to six-and-a-half laps. Typically people run anti-clockwise, although like anywhere you get a couple of geniuses who run in the opposite direction for maxiumum attention. This was the park that I came when I wanted to do 'fast' runs in Athens, although take that with a pinch of salt. Firstly because it's on a hill so you won't be setting any personal bests. Secondly, my fitness wasn't at its best while I was here, so by fast I actually mean not very fast. And thirdly, the paved path around the outside is pretty torn-up and uneven, and it gets worse after heavy rain. You can do a fastish 5k or 10k here, but I wouldn't recommend it as somewhere to come to run sprints. For that I found nowhere other than a <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/feezrmPDdgv6KE847'>running track I passed down by the water</ExternalLink>, and I didn't stop to find-out if that is open to the public. There may be other running tracks in Athens that I didn't discover.

A couple more downsides of Nea Smyrni is that despite there being an entire park inside of the path that people run on, vacuous parents opt for the outer path as the place to play with their kids, so be mindful of not stepping on stray balls or children, unless you get really annoyed with them. The second is that one day I attempted to come here for a run, and the park was closed for a school sports day. I wasn't the only one unaware of this as people were showing up every minute to walk their dog or have their daily exercise, only to be locked-out so the little fuckers inside could waddle around, so it's not somewhere that's reliably open.

When I wanted to run at a relaxed pace, I found the best thing to do was run to the sea and back. The main road near to my first room in Athens has a tram-line running down the middle of it, and I quickly realised that this tram went all the way to the sea. So for a good run when you don't know the city and you don't want to be continually stopping to get your bearings, just follow the tram tracks.

I probably should have realised this beforehand, but on my first of these runs I got to the sea and felt amazing. My watch was reading just over 5k and I'd kept a good pace, so I was thinking to myself _"wow, maybe I'm not as unfit as I thought."_

Turns-out, if you go to the sea it's downhill. Who'd have thought? But as everything here is so up and down it didn't really feel like I was going down, until I turned around and came back. And then it really felt like I was going up.

I like to run on the left of the road so I'm running towards oncoming traffic because it makes crossing the road easier, which meant the return journey was uphill in the full August sun (the way down to the beach was largely in the shade). The point I'm making, is keep something in the tank for the return leg, and don't get cocky when you get to the water still feeling fresh like I did.

In my second room in Athens I was very close to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vMauq9tLXjDh8chy7'>Philopappos Hill</ExternalLink> so I tried running here as well. You get absolutely gorgeous views from the top, including of the Acropolis, and given it's proximity, I'm surprised it doesn't get filled-up more with tourists. As it is, the paths are sufficiently quiet that you can run all around the park pretty comfortably, and if you go around the back of the hill (the side of it opposite the Acropolis) you won't really see anyone else. Still, I don't really recommend it. The ground is pretty uneven, and I found myself having to go up and down the hill twice just to do a 5k. It's a better park to come for a lunchtime walk, which is what I used it for a lot. Regardless of running, do make sure to come up here at least once while in Athens. The views are breathtaking.

The last place I ran in Athens was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/U1Dofn9awMivcpEb8'>The National Garden</ExternalLink>. I came here when running with someone else, and although fairly pleasant, it's too small to run any distance and there are a lot of people wandering around. I'd avoid running here unless you're desparate.

## Being sociable in Athens

The life of a digital nomad can be pretty lonely. While in many places in the world there are Meetups and other events designed to meet new people, the connections that you build are generally fleeting. I can be introverted or extroverted depending on my mood (and the amount of alcohol I've drunk), but generally I'm a bit stand-off-ish until I've got to know someone, which means I typically have to meet people multiple times before I feel comfortable around them.

My cause was definitely helped by being here so long, but Athens was perhaps the first place I've been as a digital nomad where I felt I really connected with people, and knew people well enough that I had a social life irrespective of any events that were being organised.

There are a couple of social groups in Athens, and some fairly unsavoury politics between them that I won't go into, but by far the best group I found was the <ExternalLink url='https://www.facebook.com/share/WDLuj2i3wCTfyB1r'>BlaBla Language Exchange</ExternalLink> in Athens.

If you haven't come across it yet, BlaBla Language Exchange operates in many cities all over the world. Who owns it? Why it exists? I'm not really sure, because each individual group seems to be run by someone who operates independently. Regardless though, the group in Athens is very, very active, and attracts some really good people.

There is a regular "language exchange" every Wednesday from 8pm at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/5191xKKPSBeLwBob9'>The High Bar</ExternalLink>. I say it like that because every language exchange I've ever been to is just an excuse to get drunk and speak English, and this one is no different. I wouldn't go if I had to actually learn a language. Then there is one or two additional events each week, such as restaurants, salsa nights, drinking as much as possible nights etc.

Every person is also free to suggest and organise their own events and promote them within the group, so a lot is happening and it's very, very active. Other groups in Athens are a little more draconian in their operations.

Athens is a really fun city and a really easy place to meet people, so I truly recommend it if that's what you're looking for.
