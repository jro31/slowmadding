If you want someone to like you, you shouldn't set the bar too high at the beginning. In my experience of people, it's the ones that I immediately like that usually end up being dickheads, where as the ones I don't take to, I become friends with over the long-term.

That's the strategy adopted by Athens. For my first couple of days I really regretted coming here, after which I fell in love with it and stayed far longer than I originally planned.

## Where I stayed

### Near Acropolis bright apartment! Next to Metro

<AccommodationAddress name='Eggeli 68' url='https://goo.gl/maps/nCAzLD6TbGTsS9v88' />

<AccommodationTable details={neosKosmosApartmentDetails} />

In keeping with the Athenian tradition of setting the bar really low so that things can only better, my stay here started terribly, but it grew into one of my favourite places that I've stayed.

It was the first and only place I stayed that wasn't self check-in during this trip to Europe. I got off the plane from Sofia and neither my UK nor my Bulgarian network would connect, so instead I instead used the airport wifi and messaged the hosts saying I was leaving the airport, so would be at the room soon. I was assured that someone would be there to meet me.

I arrived. No one was there to meet me.

Without any network, I couldn't message anyone so had to wait until someone else came into the building. I snuck-in after them while the door was open, went up to the third floor, and from there I was able to catch the apartment's wifi connection, so I again messaged and said _"I'm here, no one's here to meet me."_

_"They'll be there shortly_" was the reply.

I went up to the fourth floor, being told that was the floor the apartment was on, and I sat in the stairwell waiting for someone to show up.

Ten minutes pass. No one shows up. Fifteen minutes pass. No one shows up. Twenty minutes pass, and finally the door to one of the apartments opens. The person I was supposed to be meeting was inside the apartment but, as he said, hadn't been checking his messages. Great. So I'd been sitting in the hallway like a muppet, with him right on the other side of the door.

He'd been expecting me to ring the doorbell, but this is a building with many apartments, and no one had told me which apartment it was or which doorbell to ring, so that was well organised.

He quickly showed me around, telling me absolutely nothing that I couldn't have figured-out myself hence this in-person check-in was a bit ludicrous, but finally, more than thirty minutes after arriving at the building, I was in my room.

My first impression was... well there's not much stuff. What I mean is that often hosts will leave you food, or at least some cooking essentials like oil. Nope, none of that. There's a washing machine in the room, so surely there's some detergent somewhere? Nope, none of that either, nor any shampoo, there was only two rolls of toilet paper for my six-week stay, one of the AC remotes had no batteries, and the kettle was partially broken. So one of the first things I did after checking-in was go down to the nearby Lidl and buy all the stuff that a thoughtful host provides, none of which were included here. Well, things can only get better.

I'm a pretty low-maintenance guest, but after the shambles that was this check-in process, the company that manages this apartment (they manage several Airbnbs in Greece) were really top-notch. The kettle fully broke about a week later, and someone showed-up on a motorcycle to replace it within 24 hours. Someone called 'Eirini', who was my point of contact, was always so friendly. The wifi speeds in the room are pretty dire, and I messaged Eirini to ask if this was normal. Knowing full well she was going to do nothing about it, she replied saying _"I'll contact the network and see what they can do about it."_ The whole conversation was so cordial, I couldn't really be angry that she was only pretending she was going to try and fix it.

Predictably the speeds didn't improve, so for the duration of my stay the download speed hovered around 6mbps, and the upload speed was about 0.6mbps. For context, the upload speed when I'd been in Bucharest was around 550mbps (917 times faster), so I was surprised to find that I could actually do video calls on this connection. I have my doubts it would be good enough if other people were simultaneously connected, but that's another check in the column for loneliness.

I really liked the room though. In Sofia I'd stayed somewhere with a lack of natural light, so I absolutely loved how much light got-in here. It was such a bright apartment, and very spacious. Moving-out the coffee table, there was a huge floor space in the living room that I used most mornings for exercise. The only downside of this room being so big, was the TV was tiny, and it was miles away on the other side of the room. You could have a 60" TV in there and it wouldn't have looked out of place.

The only room that did feel a little lacking in quality was the bathroom. It's a pretty drab bathroom, but I guess it stops me sitting on the toilet for too long. Every other room was great.

The kitchen was equipped with everything you'd expect it to be, and included a counter with a couple of stools I would eat at and that was the best place to set-up a workstation. The only downside was there are two air conditioners in the apartment; one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Neither really reach the kitchen, so on very hot days it could be a bit much to work in there.

I'm never above working from my bed, and the bedroom is basic but very pleasant. Lots of natural light, lots of storage space and comfortable. The sofa in the living room was the other place I worked, but the downside is there are no plugs nearby, so anytime I did I was at the mercy of my laptop's battery.

The apartment is a short was from Neos Kosmos metro station, and I absolutely fell in love with the area. It's not at all touristy, is very peaceful, but everything you need is within easy reach.

Lidl is about a five-minute walk, and other supermarkets are a bit further. It takes about fifteen minutes to walk to Koukaki, which is a much more lively (and touristy) area not far from the Acropolis with loads of restaurants. Nea Smyrni park is a good place to run or to go for a walk, and is less than twenty minutes walking from the room. For anything else, as well as the metro, there's a tram stop less than five minutes away, so it's a lovely area.

After such a shitty start, I was really sad when I had to leave this place. It's a really great room, I hope to stay again in future.

### Cozy & Elegant Flat w/ Balcony, 10' from Acropolis

_"Hey, do you want to go to the cinema? They played a really great movie three hours ago."_

"Oh. And are they playing it again?"

_"No, but you can still get a sense that they played it."_

This isn't the typical room I'd go for. It costs more than I'd usually pay and is in a much more crowded area. When I booked it there was the possibility I'd have a friend stay with me for some of the time, so I wanted a place big enough for two people to be comfortably, and near enough to the tourist sights; something I'd normally make an effort to be away from, so in this instance I was willing to pay a little more.

Even though I ultimately didn't have anyone staying with me, I didn't regret staying here. It's a very comfortable room, and for what little it's worth, is very near to the Acropolis.

_"But the stones there are really old."_

"Really? Are they older than any other stones?"

_"Fair enough, but so many historic things happened there."_

"Oh, and are they happening there now?"

I've just never understood why you would want to go to a place where something significant once happened. And by the droves of tourists queueing like ants to get into the Acropolic any time I walked by, I am clearly the exception rather than the rule, so if that kind of thing is important to you, then this might be the perfect room for you.

## Where to run in Athens

Athens doesn't believe in flat surfaces. Anytime you go somewhere, you're either going up hill or down hill. It also doesn't believe in smooth paving. They built this city 3,000 years ago and just thought fuck it, this'll do, and haven't touched it since.

That brings some charm, but when it comes to running you need to accept that you're going to be running up hill a lot, and you need to pay attention to where you're stepping, lest your ankle become less connected. That's not to say that this is a bad place to run. I actually found some really pleasant routes, but do temper your expectations.

The other bad news is that, unlike other cities in Europe, there aren't many parks in Athens and the ones that are here are pretty small. The good news is that if you get away from the main roads, it can be a pleasant city to just run around, so don't limit yourself to running in parks while you're here.

My favourite place to run was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WcAvcoxCxhqQbmCUA'>Nea Smyrni park</ExternalLink>. It's a small park, built on a hill surprisingly, with a pretty uneven path that goes around the outside. Yes, this is what you're playing with here. One lap is just under 800m so for a 5k run you need close to six-and-a-half laps. Typically people run anti-clockwise, although like anywhere you get a couple of doorknobs who take their shirt off and run in the opposite direction for maxiumum attention. This was the park that I came when I wanted to do 'fast' runs in Athens, although take that with a pinch of salt. Firstly because it's on a hill so you won't be setting any personal bests, secondly my fitness wasn't at its best while I was here, so by fast I actually mean not very first, and thirdly the paved path around the outside is pretty torn-up and uneven, and it gets worse after heavy rain. You can do a fastish 5k or 10k here, but I wouldn't recommend it as somewhere to come to run sprints. For that I found nowhere other than a <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/feezrmPDdgv6KE847'>running track I passed down by the water</ExternalLink>, and I didn't stop to find-out if that is open to the public. There may be other running tracks in Athens that I didn't discover.

A couple more downsides of Nea Smyrni is that despite there being an entire park inside of the outer path that people run on, vacuous parents opt for the outer path as the place to play with their kids, so be mindful of not stepping on stray balls or children. The second is that one day I attempted to come here for a run, and the park was closed for a school sports day.

I wasn't the only one unaware of this as people were showing up every minute to walk their dog or have their daily exercise, only to be locked-out so the little fuckers inside could waddle around.

When I wanted to run at a relaxed pace, I found the best thing to do was run to the sea and back. The main road near to my first room in Athens had a tramline running down the middle of it, and I quickly realised that this tram went all the way to the sea. So for a good run when you don't know the city and you don't want to be continually stopping to get your bearings, just follow the tramlines.

I probably should have realised this beforehand, but on my first of these runs I got to the sea and felt amazing. My watch was reading just over 5k and I'd kept a good pace, so I was thinking to myself _"wow, maybe I'm not as unfit as I thought."_

Turns-out, if you go to the sea it's downhill. Who'd have thought? But as everything here is so up and down it didn't really feel like I was going down, until I turned around and came back. And then it really felt like I was going up.

I like to run on the left of the road because so I'm running towards oncoming traffic because it makes crossing the road easier, which meant the return journey was uphill in the full August sun (the way down to the beach was largely in the shade). The point I'm making, is keep something in the tank for the return, and don't get cocky when you get to the water still feeling fresh like I did.

In my second room in Athens I was very close to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vMauq9tLXjDh8chy7'>Philopappos Hill</ExternalLink> so I tried running here as well. You get absolutely gorgeous views from the top, including of the Acropolis, and given it's proximity, I'm surprised it doesn't get filled-up more with tourists. As it is, the paths are sufficiently quiet that you can run pretty comfortably, and if you go around the back of the hill (the side of it opposite the Acropolis) I rarely saw anyone else. Still, I don't really recommend it. The ground is pretty uneven, and I found myself having to go up and down the hill twice just to do a 5k. It's a better park to come for a lunchtime walk, which is what I used it for a lot. Regardless of running, do make sure to come up here at least once while in Athens. The views are breathtaking.

The last place I ran in Athens was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/U1Dofn9awMivcpEb8'>The National Garden</ExternalLink>. I came here when running with someone else, and although fairly pleasant, it's too small to run any distance and there are a lot of people wandering around. I'd avoid running here unless you're desparate.
