Sofia is the capital city of one of the cheapest countries in the EU. For anyone with an EU passport that makes it a very appealing destination. It's safe, has beautiful architecture, lots of green space and a mountain backdrop. So while you're in Europe, should you add Sofia to your itinerary?

No.

## Why don't I like Sofia?

### My first time in Sofia

It was late in the afternoon when my bus from Bucharest pulled-into Sofia. I took the MRT to my Airbnb, did a self check-in, put my bags down, got some food quickly, then went to a phone shop to buy a SIM card. This was at an A1 store, one of three main mobile networks in Bulgaria, in the touristy city centre, visited by many people as soon as they arrive here in order to get connected.

I'd looked online the night prior and knew that a SIM card cost 15 lev, so when I was quoted 21 lev by the girl serving me, it was more than I'd been expecting but I'd been sat on a bus all day so couldn't be arsed to question it. She put my SIM and a little freebie phone stand into a bag and I went on my way.

It was only back at my room that I inspected the receipt to see that the SIM card had in fact cost 15 lev. Without a word she'd charged me 6 lev for this shitty little phone stand that only ever found its way into the bin.

What had been essentially the first person that I spoke to in Bulgaria had scammed me out of an insignificant amount of money, but scammed me all the same. And while I'd arrived in Bulgaria uncharacteristically optimistic about how much I was going to like it, this instead moved me to a place of wondering whether or not I could trust the locals.

But you can't let the actions of one person determine your opinion of a city with well over a million, so I tried to put it out of my mind, but I found some of the local people here to be the most angry that I've encountered anywhere - just constantly in a bad mood and hating life, that when I left Sofia I just didn't really like it. It hadn't really got any better from being scammed by the first person that I met.

### Why did I come back again?

I can count on one hand the places in the world that I don't like. So with so many places in the world that I do, and so many others that I've never visited, you may be asking why I came back to Sofia for a second time.

Sofia is the capital city of one of the cheapest countries (along with Romania) in the EU. As an EU passport holder myself, that makes it very, very appealing as I can live here indefinitely and legally without any kind of visa. On top of that, with Greece to the south, North Macedonia to the west, and Romania to the north, it borders three countries that I do really like.

I try to avoid flying wherever possible, and as I was in Macedonia travelling to Romania, well why not stop in Sofia for a couple of weeks on the way? It'll save me having to fly, and perhaps I was just unlucky my first time. Perhaps the people aren't all endlessly angry, perhaps I just met the wrong ones.

### My last time in Sofia

On this visit I bought an eSIM prior to crossing the border from Macedonia, which side-stepped having to deal directly with any mobile operators. Instead on my first full day here I went firstly to the bus station where there weren't any daytime buses to Bucharest, so then onto the train station next door.

These were both the least foreigner-friendly transport terminals I've ever been to. Everything is written in Bulgarian only, which for terminals with international destinations seems a bit of an intentional inconvenience. I'd walked here from my room, so decided to use the toilet in the train station.

I hadn't yet got any Bulgarian currency since crossing the border. There was a barrier for the toilet, but it was open and there was no one there collecting money. I figured it's better than pissing on the floor.

I was only at the urinal for 30 seconds, but by the time I came out there was an overweight middle-aged woman sat at the desk, and she immediately started shouting in Bulgarian, motioning that I had to give some money. I tried to show her that I only had euros, and that just made her even more angry, and it turned-into full blown screaming in Bulgarian. All I'd done was take a piss.

I told her I'd change some euros and come back, then I legged-it.

A few minutes later I was at a ticket window buying a ticket to Bucharest. I asked to pay with card, and when I did I got a notification that the money had been taken from my UK bank account, but at the same time her ticket machine died. Despite being able to show that the money had been taken from my account, and despite it obviously being an error with their ticket machines, she was adamant that my card was the problem and that I could only pay with cash.

I was a bit annoyed that I could prove that the money had left my account and I was being asked to pay again, but even more so in paying by cash because that would involve the ATM fees of withdrawing with a foreign card, so when I protested, she too resorted to the Bulgarian default of just shouting in order to get her way.

Eventually I conceded and withdrew cash from the ATM, the only thing I paid for with cash the entire visit, and the failed transaction later got reimbursed into my bank account. But on my first day back, I'd had not one but two people shout at me. Ok, time to get back to my room and avoid people for the rest of the day.

The last time that I'd been in Sofia, the closest thing I had to a regular vegan restaurant was a place to Edgy Veggie. It was around the corner from both my Airbnb and my gym, so I found myself there a lot. According to Google Maps it opens at 11am, so the next day I went there at about 11:35am for lunch.

There were no other customers, but the door was open so I wandered in, but instead of being greeted as a customer, an old woman working there (you might be seeing a theme) came out and said something in Bulgarian.

It's worth noting that this is a restaurant in the touristy centre of the city with English signs and an English menu - they're clearly trying to get foreigners to come in here. It's not like I was in a local restaurant at the edge of the city.

I obviously didn't understand what she said, and her response to me asking if she spoke English, was again to just start shouting in Bulgarian. To this point I have no idea why or what about, but it was enough to make me leave the restaurant, and I didn't return.

I'd say that in a typical year, I'll have one or two interactions like this all year. It's very rare. I'm patient with people and I avoid conflict wherever I can, so it's very, very rare for me to have negative interactions. And whereas outside Bulgaria, it happens once or twice per year, I'd been back in the country for less than 48 hours at this point, and I'd already had enough of the people. For the remainder of my stay I interacted with locals absolutely no more than necessary.

When I eventually took the train to Bucharest I was in a berth with other foreigners, and as we talked it was apparent my experience was not an isolated one. Everyone else said the same thing - Bulgarians are just always angry. For whatever reason they hate life, and it makes Sofia an unenjoyable place to visit.

## Getting in and out of Sofia

Getting into Sofia is easy. If you arrive by air, line 4 of the metro goes to the airport, and if you arrive by bus or train, then a station for line 2 is right there, as well as trams and buses.

Leaving by air is equally easy, however I've never been to bus and train stations that are so foreigner-unfriendly. If you're leaving by bus or train and need to buy tickets in person, then good luck. Don't expect to find any signs in English, and don't expect any people to speak English.

## How to pay for things in Sofia

Card payments, including contactless like Apple Pay are accepted basically everywhere, so you don't really need cash. You'll find a few annoying exceptions, like if you want to pay to use the toilet in the train station.

At present the currency of Bulgaria is the lev, however it's set to join the euro on 1st January 2026. There will presumably be a bit of a transitional period where both currencies are accepted, but during my visit it was still only the lev - no one was accepting euros yet.

## How affordable is Sofia?

Along with Romania, Bulgaria is the cheapest country within the EU. You'll find accommodation in Sofia to be roughly half the price of something equivalent in Athens. However, coming here from North Macedonia there was a noticeable jump in prices, so there are cheaper places to stay in this region if money really matters to you.

## What language is spoken in Sofia?

Bulgarian. And very loudly.

## How easy is it to get by with English in Sofia?

Not as easy as you'd imagine for the capital city of an EU country with a modest tourist presence. Even going into business with English signs that are clearly trying to appeal to foreigners, the staff often don't speak English.

## How is the Internet in Sofia?

Perfectly fast and reliable for remote working. During my last stay I had download speeds of around 80mbps and upload speeds of 86mbps.

## Is Sofia safe?

Very much so. I've never really sensed any kind of crime while I've been here.

## Who is Sofia suitable for?

Sadomasochists.

If you need to go somewhere cheap, then go to North Macedonia. If you want to stay within the EU then go to Bucahrest. Sofia doesn't offer anything that you can't find in neigbouring countries, other than pain and sadness.

## Is there anything good about Sofia?

It's a beautiful place. Lots of green space, a mountain backdrop, and very pleasing achitecture. If you're an introvert and don't plan on interacting with the people at all, then Sofia is a lovely place. It's once you learn how angry everyone is that the beauty of it seems to matter much less.

## Is the tap water drinkable in Sofia?

Very much so.

## Throwing away your rubbish in Sofia

If you've been to Athens or Skopje, Sofia's sanitation system is the same. Every couple of hundred metres you'll find a big wheelie bin at the side of the road. Throw your trash in there. No bin days that you have to remember or anything like that.

## Being sociable in Sofia

TODO: Rewrite this?

There's really not that much going on from a perspective of events designed for meeting new people in Sofia. The only group running regular events on Meetup is the <ExternalLink url='https://www.meetup.com/sofia-international-friends-and-language-exchange/'>Sofia International Friends and Language exchange </ExternalLink> group. I attended three of their events, and they were quite curious affairs. The "organiser" didn't show up to any of them, and according to the people I met, doesn't ever show up to any of them, yet he continually updates the number of guests he's bringing to each event on the app, which inflates the number of attendees to make it look really popular.

My assumption is he has some association to McCarthys Irish Pub, the bar that these events are held in, and does this to get more people to attend, but I never found anyone to corroborate my story.

With that consideration, despite these Meetups boasting upwards of 25 attendees, the reality was it would range from four to ten, but they were still fun. I say that from the perspective of someone who's quite happy to sit in a bar alone, so take it with a pinch of salt, but the lesser attended events can be more fun because you get to know a small number of people well instead of meeting thirty people and not remembering a single name.

These were the only organised events I attended in Sofia, but I encountered one more when in a bar, a dozen or more miserable looking people not talking to each other wandered in. I chatted to who turned-out to be the organiser, and these people had all just met each other and came into this bar on the first stop of their <ExternalLink url='https://pubcrawlsofia.com/'>Sofia Pub Crawl</ExternalLink> which, as I found out, is a pub crawl that runs every Friday and Saturday and you can attend for 25 lev.

My assumption is that once they got comfortable with each other and the alcohol had flowed a bit, then they probably loosened-up and had some fun. They'd signed-up for a pub crawl after all. That's another option, but in truth I didn't find much more here.

If you're a very socially-needy person then Sofia might not be for you.

## Where to run in Sofia

TODO: Rewrite this?

In my month in Bucharest prior to coming here, I got back into interval running. That's short bursts of high-speed running, rather than long, slow runs as people typically do. My hope before coming to Sofia was that I would continue doing at least some interval running, but what that requires is a flat, even, unimpeded surface, preferably in a loop.

Looking at a map you'll see that Sofia has several parks. Nearest to my room was the <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/Vf1xbR1S9pSpBwn37'>National Palace of Culture Park</ExternalLink>. I wasn't expecting much from this, but a little further on is South Park. Carry on going, and you get to another park, also called South Park. You'd think they could have come up with another name.

To differentiate between them I'm going to refer to them as <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/FVzLkyp1frUZ3WUx7'>north South Park</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/2nzsSinFvwNFFDFZ9'>south South Park</ExternalLink>.

My expectation was that north South Park would be a good place to do faster runs. The reason that it's not, isn't that it's not big enough or flat enough. It's that all the paths just go straight across the park, so you can't actually do any loops without diverting over stretches of grass that are pretty uneven under-foot. I tried to do a fast run here when I first arrived, and I just couldn't do it. And yes I am blaming the directions of the paths and the unevenness of the grass for why I got such a shit time. It was nothing to do with my lack of fitness or willpower.

From that I concluded that Sofia is better for longer, slower runs, for which it is really good. The pavements and roads are quiet enough that you can comfortably run down the street, but with a bit of planning you can do some decent-lengthed runs mostly through parks.

I started by combining National Palace of Culture Park with north South Park and south South Park, but later graduated onto including <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/irA1U3acEKrzqe9P8'>Borisova Gradina Park</ExternalLink>, which turned it into a 12km loop where almost all of Borisova Gradina Park, and the south half of south South Park are some pretty isolated trails. It was really enjoyable, with the only downside being that they're so winding that keeping your bearings is near impossible. I often found myself stopping to check the map on my watch, only to see I was going in the opposite direction to what I thought.

On my last run in Sofia, I was going down one of these isolated, winding trails only to come across an old man lying on the path. I stopped, and on the assumption he didn't speak English put my thumb up and asked him _"ok?"_

_"Help,"_ was his response in a very timid voice. He didn't seem to know any other words, but when he started trying to stand up, I pulled him off the ground and had to hold him steady for about twenty seconds, lest he go back down again. He was carrying a crutch and had a bandage around one leg, which made me wonder if going on walks down isolated, uneven trails was the best thing for him. He could have been there for hours already, and had I not come along, might have been for many more.

His dog didn't give a fuck either. He was just chilling on the ground. Forget Lassie, that dog wasn't going to do shit.

If you are intent on doing faster runs, on the right if you enter south South Park from the north, is a place called <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/oY3b7U9UVJZ1oYjF8'>Great Round Meadow</ExternalLink>. It's not that great, but it's flat, the path is fairly wide, and it's more or less round so you can use it for sprints just as long as you're willing to push the occasional pensioner out the way. That was the only place I came across suitable for faster running.

## Where to get vegan food in Sofia

Of the three vegan restaurants that I recommended in the first edition of this article, two had closed-down by the time I returned, and the one that remained, <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/wKFAdnfZiyaCqfqG7'>Edgy Veggy</ExternalLink>, has changed its menu for the worse and has a crazy old bag working there now.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/RZaaCcMffxNteRBx8'>Loving Hut</ExternalLink> is another vegan place you could try, but it's unreliable in its hours as I've found it to be closed when it says its open on multiple occasions. If you do eat here, the food is uninspiring at best.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/yrQatL8L2nCDCXtN9'>So Fresh</ExternalLink> is a slighlty generic sandwich shop, but they do have a couple of vegan sandwiches on the menu, and one block away is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/VeYdhhHA2YKstnBN6'>Coffee Fellows</ExternalLink>, a coffee shop that's uncomfortably popular with people sitting on their laptops, but that does have a couple of vegan bagels.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/e8bzov1KAqteribi6'>Hummusbar</ExternalLink> really should be my kind of place. It serves meat, but has some vegan options clearly maked on the menu. Yet, despite having English menus and signs in English, when I came not only did the guy working the till not speak a word of English, but he didn't know how the till worked either. He charged me 9.60 lev for a 16.90 meal. I did the honourable thing and pointed this out to him, but he didn't know how to do refunds either, so he charged me 6.70 for another meal because it was the closest thing on the menu to make-up the difference. Despite the ordering issues, the food was excellent.



TODO: Rewrite this

Unlike in Bucharest, where I'd been prior, mainstream supermarkets in Sofia don't cater well to vegans. There are no vegan sections, you just have to wander around and pick-out the odd vegan item they happen to have.

For specialised vegan products, like vegan cheese, there are little health food shops dotted all over Sofia. The closest for me was <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/7NCTkZgorb8nwMsd7'>Zelen Bio Store</ExternalLink>, but there are many others.

From a self-catering perspective I found myself limited to meals like hummus pasta and sandwiches, which meant I relied a lot on vegan restaurants. Sofia doesn't have a huge selection of vegan restaurants, but the ones it does have I found to be really good. These are my favourites.

### Edgy Veggy

TODO: Delete this?

<MapLink name='William Gladstone 18' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/wKFAdnfZiyaCqfqG7' />

When I choose an Airbnb, I always get a place with a nearby vegan restaurant, and Edgy Veggy was one of the key reasons I ended up staying where I did. If it wasn't very good it would have been a great disappointment, but luckily I loved it.

It's a fully vegan restaurant, and sells a mix of junk foods like burgers and burritos, with healthier options like avocado toast and salads. I didn't eat anything here that I didn't think was really high quality, and being so close to both my gym and my room, I would often come here after a workout for lunch. They also sell protein shakes.

While the food was always top-notich, the service can suffer occasionally. It's supposed to open at 10am everyday, but one day I came at 10:40am only to be told that they would open _"maybe at 11:30."_ Other days I came earlier and they were open, so it's a bit of pot-luck. As is coming here at busy times because, despite being quite a big premesis, they don't have much seating, and if you can't get one of the tables, the bars around the outside aren't so comfortable.

It's essentially a fast food restaurant, so on most days you'll have your food within 5-10 minutes of ordering, but this too was unreliable. One day I waited 27 minutes for a burrito, which was a little frustrating as I'd only come in for a quick lunch.

The positives definitely outweigh the negatives and the food is always good, but beware that the service isn't always on point.

### Groceries

In the first edition of this article, I recommeneded a really good, vegan-friendly health store called Zelen. That's now closed down too, and buying healthy, vegan good in Sofia is something of a pain.

I eat a lot of pasta for example, but I try to only ever eat wholewheat. And where do you buy wholewheat pasta in Sofia?

I'm actually asking, because I couldn't find any. It's not in Lidl and it's not in Billa, the two main supermarket chains here. And in the absence of Zelen I instead went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZKkLsqrd7xutqRGA'>Zoya</ExternalLink>, another health food shop. Even they don't sell it, with the closest equivalent being very overpriced buckwheat pasta.

Lidl is good for fruit and veg, Zoya is good for overpriced health food shop type foods, but if you want a high protein, vegan diet as I did while I was here as I was working out a lot and trying to put on a bit of weight, you're probably going to resort to vegan protein powders at one of the many supplement stores, like <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/noukqGz4okpQGSFL6'>Fitness1.bg</ExternalLink>. I typically try to eat as naturally as possible, but that's not so easy in Sofia.

Evolution: "I've spent 3.5 billion years perfecting a biological rhythm where people rise and sleep with daylight."

Humans: "Lol."

This apartment is on the ground floor. I typically avoid ground floor rooms for security reasons, but there are decorative bars here sufficient to mitigate any risk of someone climbing through the windows, and the door looks like it could guard Fort Knox. From a security perspective, this room is as safe as anywhere I've stayed. From a privacy perspective it's less so.

On the plus side the room is on the rear side of the building, so you don't have to worry about people peering in as they wander down the street. On the negative side, it's next to a restaurant and all the staff take their smoke breaks out the back, and should you leave the curtains open, they can look at you lying in bed.

Human beings have created some dumb inventions before, but perhaps the dumbest of them is black-out curtains: Disrupting your circadian rhythm since World War II. Save for some largely transparent drapes, this room only has black-out curtains. And as someone who likes to get as much daylight as possible, my time here was a constant battle between closing the curtains enough to have privacy, but not closing them so much that I didn't get enough daylight.

Save for the crippling loneliness, despondency and endless longing for it to all be over, the great thing about being alone is that you get to have an entire bed to yourself. I don't have a side of the bed, I always just sleep in the middle. So when I stay somewhere with an alleged double-bed, but it's actually two single mattresses, then God can go fuck himself. I don't know who thinks that's a good idea. Why would you want to sleep in the same bed as someone but be forced to be on different sides of it? If that's what you want then just sleep in different beds. Or different rooms. Or just get a divorce and get it over with.

The room is a studio, which had I paid more attention when booking I would have realised. Studios are only really bad things when you're with someone else and you have nowhere to get away from them. Again touting the benefits of soul-crushing desolation, when you're in a studio by yourself, it can be better than having a one-bedroom because you get the same amount of space without all the walls getting in the way.

That's not really the case here, it's actually quite small, but in other places.

There's just room to comfortably do yoga, which is all the space I really need. Any more is being greedy, and this room has this empty space despite also having a dining table with two chairs, an armchair, a desk with an office chair, and a double bed that some nobhead put two mattresses on.

The kitchen area is a bit lacking. It has an induction hob that you can unplug and put in a drawer when you're not using it. I used to think they were a poor alternative to having a permanent cooker, but having used them in multiple Airbnbs now, I actually think they're an improvement. You can take them out whenever you want to cook, but the rest of the time you put them away and have more surface space.

It also has a microwave-grill, which I'd never heard of until I stayed here. It's a microwave and a grill. Together. A microwave-grill. No, I don't know who came up with that either. Probably the same guy who invented blackout curtains. I found some minimal use for it by getting some baguettes from the nearby Lidl and toasting them, but it definitely wasn't adequate replacement for an oven.

The first thing I look for when choosing an Airbnb, and the reason that I never pay much attention to the details of the room, is the location. I want the room to be in a good location, which for me means it has four things nearby: Somewhere to run, a gym, vegan food and a supermarket. For as much as it could be anywhere in Sofia, this room is in a perfect location.

My favourite vegan restaurant here, Edgy Veggy, is a 150 metre walk. My gym when I was here, <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/MmdptJZ48y9R8Drw8'>Silver Gym</ExternalLink>, is a 250m walk. Lidl is a 550m walk, with additional supermarkets not much further. And while you can comfortably go running from right out the front door, the north-west corner of the National Palace of Culture Park is only a 350m walk.

The gym was so close that I'd walk there in my workout clothes, go straight from the gym to Edgy Veggy, which conveniently sells protein shakes to have with your lunch, and be back at my room within an hour. The location was amazing, and made-up for the frustrations of the room, however slight they were.

This is a room that I'd recommend for anytime of year... except the time that I stayed here.

When I booked it I was aware that it didn't have any AC, but I was thinking _"Ah, it probably won't be that hot."_

As my check-in date approached and it was clear that I'd be coming during a heatwave, I even looked-up other accommodations in Sofia, but found that an equivalent room with AC would cost about £200 more for my 13-night stay, so decided fuck it. For £200 I'd rather be hot for a couple of weeks.

I regretted that.

The good news is that its a ground floor room that doesn't get much direct sunlight. Considering the outside temperatures, the room actually stays very cool, but that's relative. I knew that there wasn't any AC, but I assumed that the host would at least include a fan. They didn't. When trying to sleep especially, that made my stay here very uncomfortable. Had I come at any other time of year I think it would have been a lovely room.

The location is really good - you're only a short walk from South Park, which is great for running or for going for a walk in the evening, and you're close by to the MRT. You're also an easy walk from the city centre while being away from all the tourists. And the room itself is pretty nice. It's much bigger than I'd been expecting from the photos on Airbnb. There's loads of space for exercise without having to even move any furniture.

It feels a little bare in its equipment. There's a kitchen, but it doesn't include a frying pan, or a colander, or any paper towel. There's enough that you can say on Airbnb that you provide a kitchen, but they certainly haven't gone too the care of providing everything you might need, like some hosts do. And the cooker itself is the only cooker I've ever encountered that's not powerful enough to boil water. I'd boil it in the kettle, then the cooker could just about keep it hot enough to cook pasta, but if you put a pan of water on to boil you'll be waiting there all day.

Usually the most important thing when I stay somewhere, is how much natural light gets in, and I intentionally stayed here because of its big windows. However thanks to trees and other buildings, very little natural light actually gets in, and it's quite a dingy room, even in the daytime. For once this was a blessing, as being in direct sunlight would have made it even hotter.

Due to the heat, I kept the windows open 24 hours per day. The apartment is part of a complex that surrounds a little wooded area. That made it quite nice to sit on the balcony with a cup of tea, but you'll find that a lot of noise comes from the surrounding apartments. Dogs barking, babies crying, and most annoyingly was the guy who'd sit on his balcony every morning coughing while smoking cigarettes. You can't fix stupid.

The wifi had 80mbps download speeds and 86mbps upload speeds during my tests and was perfectly reliable.

This room won't blow you away, but you could definitely do worse. I just recommend that you do not stay here during the summer months. If you're at all sensitive to the heat, you'll hate it.
