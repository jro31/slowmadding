Nakhon Ratchasima (also known as Korat) is Thailand's third largest city, and Udon Thani (often known simply as Udon) is its sixth. Together they comprise two of the 'big four of Isaan', and yet foreign tourism in both cities is scant. This means that finding reliable information about them, including how to travel between them, is almost impossible online and you just have to arrive and start figuring it out for yourself.

Luckily for you, I recently travelled from Nakhon Ratchasima to Udon by bus and had to figure-out how, so to save you the trouble, here's everything I learned.

## Where to catch a bus to Udon Thani in Nakhon Ratchasima

There are two bus terminals in Nakhon Ratchasima.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GdaR98K7MdH7pnpk7'>Bus Terminal 1</ExternalLink> is close to the centre of town, and is the smaller of the two terminals. It has buses to Bangkok and a few other destinations, but **it does not have any buses to Udon Thani**.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/XzDnmf79xNmzYea96'>Bus Terminal 2</ExternalLink> is a little further out of town, past Terminal 21. It is much bigger and has buses to many more destinations, including Bangkok and Udon Thani.

### Bus Terminal 2

The layout of Bus Terminal 2 is that it has two long, thin terminals. Passengers wait within these open terminals, while buses pull-up to the 'gates' that go around them. There is no central ticketing area. Instead you buy your tickets at the counters in front of the gate where your bus departs from.

A lot more buses leave from the westerly terminal (furthest from the main road), including buses to Udon Thani, which depart from gate 4.

(One other company does offer a bus to Udon, but it's only one per day, at 1:30pm if my Thai doesn't betray me.)

## What time do buses leave for Udon Thani?

From gate 4, there are twelve buses to Udon Thani each day. The first leaves at 6am, the second at 7:20am. Then from 8:30am to 1:30pm, they leave every hour on the half hour. The last four buses depart at 2:40pm, 4pm, 5:30pm and 7:30pm.

[**You do not need to buy tickets in advance**. Perhaps with the exception of holidays, simply showing up at the a few minutes before the bus leaves is sufficient (at least, that's what I did).]

A ticket costs...

## Taking the bus from Nakhon Ratchasima to Udon Thani

If you arrive early for your bus and need to use the bathroom, there is a 5 baht charge for the toilets within Bus Terminal 2. However I found that there's a small shopping parade nearby (before you even get to the main road) that includes a 7-11. This includes some free toilets for if you don't have any change, or if you're just cheap like me.
