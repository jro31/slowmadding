When most people pack a suitcase to go on holiday, they leave behind a house or an apartment full of possessions to return to. As a digital nomad the stakes are a little higher - we pack every single item we own, so should something happen to out baggage in transit we can be left, quite literally, with nothing.

While you can never mitigate the risk entirely, you can pack in such a way to leave yourself standing through as many possible scenarios as possible.

The airline loses your checked bag? Do you have the documents you need to prove your identity? Do you still have access to money? What about if your hand luggage goes missing? Have you packed in a way that you can get yourself back on your feet then? What about both? Maybe you get robbed and all your bags are taken, are you carrying enough on your person that you can still get money to pay for food and accommodation until you're back on your feet?

When the stakes are so high that you carry every possession you own with you on your days in transit, these are the questions you need to ask yourself.
