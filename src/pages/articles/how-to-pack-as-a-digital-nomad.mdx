When most people pack a suitcase to go on holiday, they leave behind a house or an apartment full of possessions to return to. As a digital nomad the stakes are a little higher - we pack every single item we own, so should something happen to out baggage in transit we can be left, quite literally, with nothing.

While you can never mitigate the risk entirely, you can pack in such a way to leave yourself standing through as many possible scenarios as possible.

The airline loses your checked bag? Do you have the documents you need to prove your identity? Do you still have access to money? What about if your hand luggage goes missing? Have you packed in a way that you can get yourself back on your feet then? What about both? Maybe you get robbed and all your bags are taken, are you carrying enough on your person that you can still get money to pay for food and accommodation until you're back on your feet?

When the stakes are so high that you carry every possession you own with you on your days in transit, these are the questions you need to ask yourself.

PASTED FROM OTHER ARTICLE - UPDATE ACCORDINGLY:

I know that some digital nomads out there travel with only hand luggage, for whom this section is irrelevant. I am not one of them. I carry about 15kg worth of stuff beyond my hand luggage, and while that might include things that don't seem essential to others (like my yoga mat and blocks, and my blender), I wouldn't want to live without them.

When you pack, the key thing to consider is it is far more likely that any checked baggage goes missing than it is any hand luggage, so in your hand luggage have the following:

- Any items of significant value
  - Most obviously, your laptop
- Any essential items
  - Your phone and charger are the obvious ones, debit/credit cards are another
- Any items it will be or may be necessary to have easy access to before you get to your next room
  - Passport(s), currency
- Any items that will make the journey more relaxing
  - Like a book or some headphones

In your checked baggage have everything else; all the items that, while it would be a pain and a small expense to have to replace them, won't cripple you if they go missing. I can live without my yoga mat if I have to. I can live without my blender. I can live without my five year old underwear and my t-shirts with holes in. In fact, the airline might be doing me a favour if it forces me to replace them.

While these are good general rules to follow, it's not quite that simple. Travelling is a game of hoping for the best but preparing for the worst, and while it's more likely your checked baggage goes missing than anything else, it's not the only possibility.

You could lose your hand luggage. If you're really unlucky, you could lose both. Get into the wrong taxi and the driver turns around and points a gun at you, telling you to get out and leave your bags, are you prepared for that situation?

When you pack, ask yourself three questions:

- Can I survive if I lose my checked baggage?
- Can I survive if I lose my hand luggage?
- Can I survive if I lose both?

You cannot prepare for all eventualities. Stories of people being robbed and stripped even of their clothes, left naked in the middle of nowhere, how do you prepare for that? Keep a debit card in your anus?

You don't, but you can still be as prepared as possible.

Any self-respecting digital nomad will have more ways of accessing their money than they're hopefully ever going to need. For example, I have five different physical debit cards (as well as numerous virtual debit cards), and on days I'm travelling, I carry two in my pockets (different pockets), two in my hand luggage (in different sections of my bag), and one in my checked baggage.

That way, if I get pick-pocketed, I still have three more cards, if I lose my hand luggage, I still have three more cards, if I lose my checked baggage, I still have four more cards, and if I lose all my bags, I still have two cards in my pockets.

Perhaps you lose your hand luggage including your passport(s), what then? As well as a photocopy of your passport, make sure to keep some secondary identification (such as a driver's licence) in your checked baggage. Something that you can show to local authorities to prove who you are.

You cannot prepare for all eventualities, but you can get as prepared for as many of them as possible, and pack your bags accordingly.
