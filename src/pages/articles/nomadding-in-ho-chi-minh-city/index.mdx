## Where to get vegan food in Ho Chi Minh City

I'm going to make an unexpected revelation about Vietnam:

There's a lot of Vietnamese food here.

Yeah, alright I know that's obvious. But the reason that I bring it up, is that if you go to a very touristy city, usually a large percentage of the vegan restaurants are aimed at foreigners. For example in Bangkok, many of the vegan restaurants there serve western food and charge tourist prices.

When you look at a map of vegan restaurants in Ho Chi Minh, you'll see loads of them. Hundreds. So your first thought if you've been to other major tourist cities in this region, is that you'll be able to get loads of vegan western food.

The reality is actually that the vast, vast majority of these vegan restaurants serve Vietnamese food. And while you can count hundreds of vegan restaurants in this city, you can count on your fingers those that don't serve Vietnamese food.

Fortunately I like Vietnamese food. Unfortunately I don't like to eat it for every single meal, and it's in those non-Vietnamese meals that you'll find your options somewhat lacking.

Such places do exist, but you may find yourself going to them more often that you'd like.
