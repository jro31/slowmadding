## Where to get vegan food in Ho Chi Minh City

I'm going to make an unexpected revelation about Vietnam:

There's a lot of Vietnamese food here.

Yeah, alright I know that's obvious. But the reason that I bring it up, is that if you go to a very touristy city, usually a large percentage of the vegan restaurants are aimed at foreigners. For example in Bangkok, many of the vegan restaurants there serve western food and charge tourist prices.

When you look at a map of vegan restaurants in Ho Chi Minh, you'll see loads of them. Hundreds. So your first thought if you've been to other major tourist cities in this region, is that you'll be able to get loads of vegan western food.

The reality is actually that the vast, vast majority of these vegan restaurants serve Vietnamese food. And while you can count hundreds of vegan restaurants in this city, you can count on your fingers those that don't serve Vietnamese food.

Fortunately I like Vietnamese food. Unfortunately I don't like to eat it for every single meal, and it's in those non-Vietnamese meals that you'll find your options somewhat lacking.

Such places do exist, but you may find yourself going to them more often that you'd like.

### Thái Hòa

Thái Hòa, and the next door Phương Hà, are two nearly identical stores that have the greatest selection of western food that I came across anywhere in Ho Chi Minh.

I went to Phương Hà right after arriving in Ho Chi Minh, but found it such a harrowing experience that I left, swearing under my breath never to return.

It wasn't that it didn't have what I wanted. It was that I was slightly on edge, still being very new to the city and figuring-out what was going on, as well as having just had a brutal journey here from Phnom Penh [ADD LINK TO ARTICLE], and these shops are incredibly, incredibly claustrophobic. They have the narrowest aisles of any shop I've ever been in, to the point that wearing a small rucksack, as I was, it's a genuine challenge to pass people.

I had happened to come at a busy time, and despite seeing things I wanted to buy, my inability to actually get to any of these items led me to storming out, promising to never come back.

A couple of weeks passed-by, and as I grew tired of Vietnamese food, I reneged on my promise to not come back to these shops again, but I made sure to come back when I was in a calm and good mood, at a time that they were quiet.

This time I instead went to Thái Hòa, and was able to last long enough to pick-up some items that I could cook with, some of which I didn't see on sale anywhere else in Ho Chi Minh.

They have all kinds of raw nuts and seeds; something that was a staple of my diet before becoming a nomad, but that isn't too easy to have in your diet when living as a nomad, because they aren't things that many restaurants serve. I also got some wholewheat pasta, some vegan sauces and some chickpeas, so I could make some wholefood dinners for myself.

If you want to do any cooking while you're in Ho Chi Minh, then Thái Hòa is the place to come to the staples you need to cook with (it's not so great for fruit and veg). Just try to come here when you're relaxed, and don't come at a time that it's busy. Seriously.

## Where to run in Ho Chi Minh City

I'll be blunt: This is not a running-friendly city.

When I booked my room, I looked at a map and thought that Tao Dan Park park would be a short enough walk and of a sufficient size to go running. And while it was the best of a very uninspiring list of places that I ran while I was here, I found out the hard way that it's not always open to the public.

From when I arrived, the park was closed in preparation for Tet (Vietnamese New Year) celebrations more than a week away, so in the mean time I had to find alternatives.

Places that I heard about as potentially being good for running, were <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/aoMJcbvKr9YMoL8S8'>Sala Park Urban area</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/PHT1cUtQS3jRN19q6'>Vinhomes Central Park</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/DLkdDh2fSxpeyLRM7'>Phu Tho Stadium</ExternalLink>. All were sufficiently far from where I was staying that I didn't try running in them.

Instead I tried to find alternatives closer to home, with dubious results. None were very enjoyab le places to run, so I ran as little as I felt I could get away with while in Ho Chi Minh, while still maintaining some remnants of fitness.

### District 4 riverside

I never saw anyone else running down the riverside, but being right across the road from my room, and with no roads to cross and no motorbikes on the path, it seemed as good as anywhere else to go running.

Unfortunately, with a main road on one side and the very polluted river on the other, it didn't exactly feel like I was running in fresh air. To make it worse, there were spots along the route that had clearly been earmarked as the designated peeing spots, because you'd be running along and suddenly get hit in the face by this overwhelming stench of urine.

Certain areas of the path, particularly under bridges, also house many homeless people, which isn't really a problem. I didn't at any point feel unsafe, just a bit bad that I was going running through the place that they call home.

My starting point was mid-way along the river. I began by going south-west until the path ran out. I then turned around and went north-east until I met the same fate. I then turned around and went south-west again until I was back where I started. That came to just over 5km, so for all its flaws, the one advantage this route has over the other places on this list is that you don't have to cross the same ground over and over and over again. And if you're staying where I'm staying, and convenience is a factor to you, then you can't get a more convenient route than this. It's right outside the building. Still not a run I'd recommend though.
