## Where to run in Siem Reap

Siem Reap is something of an anomaly in major south-east Asian cities, in that you can pretty much run anywhere. There are obvious exceptions, like Pub Street in the evenings, but in the main it has wide, flat pavements, largely void of motorcycles, cars and other impediments, and very few pedestrians. The traffic isn't very dense either, meaning that firstly, crossing the road isn't a long process, so it won't really interrupt your run. Secondly, the pollution from vehicles is a non-factor. And thirdly, if you do find yourself in a place without pavement, running in the road is fairly safe. So it's a great place to just run in any direction and see where you end up.

On my first run here, I decided to go to the river and just head north. The first half of this route I was running along paving in populated areas. At some point thought, the paving turned to a dirt road [parallelled] by fewer and fewer buildings and more and more jungle. I stopped seeing any other foreigners, and the locals that were there became fewer and farther between.

I got the feeling that they weren't used to seeing foreigners running up there. Most ignored me, but some pointed, others said _"hello"_ with a big grin on their face like it was a novelty, and one pulled his cock out of his shorts and started windmilling it in my direction, which was a bit weird. I also got chased by a pack of dogs, but they were barking. I've always understood that dogs who bark have no intention of biting you, it's the ones that stalk silently behind you that you need to worry about, so I wasn't too fussed by this.

My intention for this run had been to cross the river once I got to 5km and come back on the other side for a 10km run. I'd love to have a good excuse for why I didn't make it all the way, but the truth is that after a month in Ho Chi Minh City, where I didn't find any good places to run, my fitness was dog shit, and when it started to hurt, I didn't have that dawg in me to push through.

I must be getting old.
