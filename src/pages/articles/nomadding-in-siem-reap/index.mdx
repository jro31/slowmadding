## Where to get vegan food in Siem Reap

Whenever I go somewhere new, I'll look up loads of restaurants that I want to go to. Inevitably though, I'll go to a just few of them, and then keep going back to the ones I like, telling myself that I'll try a new one tomorrow. Then I leave having only been to a fraction of the restaurants that I wanted, and really regret it.

On coming to Siem Reap, as usual I saved a list of places I wanted to eat at. There were [21] different restaurants on my list. Except this time, I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to any of them, until I'd been to each one once...

## Where to run in Siem Reap

Siem Reap is something of an anomaly in major south-east Asian cities, in that you can pretty much run anywhere. There are obvious exceptions, like Pub Street in the evenings, but in the main it has wide, flat pavements, largely void of motorcycles, cars and other impediments, and very few pedestrians. The traffic isn't very dense either, meaning that firstly, crossing the road isn't a long process, so it won't really interrupt your run. Secondly, the pollution from vehicles is a non-factor. And thirdly, if you do find yourself in a place without pavement, running in the road is fairly safe. So it's a great place to just run in any direction and see where you end up.

On my first run here, I decided to go to the river and just head north. The first half of this route I was running along paving in populated areas. At some point thought, the paving turned to a dirt road [parallelled] by fewer and fewer buildings and more and more jungle. I stopped seeing any other foreigners, and the locals that were there became fewer and farther between.

I got the feeling that they weren't used to seeing foreigners running up there. Most ignored me, but some pointed, others said _"hello"_ with a big grin on their face like it was a novelty, and one pulled his cock out of his shorts and started windmilling it in my direction. That was a bit weird. I also got chased by a pack of dogs, but they were barking. I've always understood that dogs who bark have no intention of biting you, it's the ones that stalk silently behind you that you need to worry about, so I wasn't too fussed by this.

My intention for this run had been to cross the river once I got to 5km and come back on the other side for a 10km run. I'd love to have a good excuse for why I didn't make it all the way, but the truth is that after a month in Ho Chi Minh City, where I didn't find any good places to run, my fitness was dog shit, and when it started to hurt, I didn't have that dawg in me to push through.

I must be getting old.

## Being sociable in Siem Reap

There are a small number of organised events in Siem Reap where you can go to meet new people. In truth though, it's a city where everyone already seems rather chatty.

I really enjoyed my time here, which I'm sure helped. As I was happy the whole time, I was much more approachable and willing to approach others. I don't think it was just me though. I found that just going to a bar or a restaurant, I would find myself talking to people. Much more tourists than locals, I think the relaxed atmosphere here, especially compared to the cities of Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City where I'd been for the two months prior, just nurtures a more friendly and approachable vibe that everyone buys into.

It doesn't hurt that beer is so cheap. Typically you'll pay $1 for a beer, but if you search around you can find beer for as low as 50¢. Anything more than a dollar and you've gone somewhere posh.

I'm not normally a big drinker, but at that price it's rude not to, so I'd often find myself getting a beer with my meal, or I'd go and sit in a bar if I wanted to read my book. And as happens, I'd go to read my book at 5pm and find myself stumbling out at 3am having spent the entire night chatting to people.

That being said, it can still be useful to have specific events to attend.

### Killer Pool at Duckbar and Minimart

Duckbar and Minimart is a convenience store/bar (don't ask) that was newly opened during my time in Siem Reap. It has a pool table in the middle of the store/bar, and a week after I arrived held the inaugural weekly killer pool tournament.

For those who aren't familiar, killer pool is a form of pool where all players get three lives. Everyone takes it in turn at the table, and if you don't pot anything you lose a life. The last man standing wins.

This first event attracted a couple of dozen people, either playing or watching, each getting through plenty of beer while there, so when I asked Chris, the store/bar's co-owner if it was going to be a weekly event, I don't think at that moment he'd decided for sure, but it's what it became.

Standing around a pool table with so many other players is a very easy environment to chat to people, especially as everyone's name is on a blackboard to mark the game order.

The one downside, for me at least, is that seemingly every other person here was chain smoking the entire night.

It's an open store/bar, and very well ventilated, but I still found that part of it slightly unpleasant. Not enough to stop me going back again though.
