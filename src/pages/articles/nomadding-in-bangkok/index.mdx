## Where I stayed

Before looking for somewhere to stay in Thailand, you should be aware that rentals of less than 30 days are illegal in Thailand at any property that is not registered as a hotel.

In Thailand, the way that the law is written and the way that the law is enforced do not strictly align, and many people will rent privately from landlords for less than 30 day without issue. However, there are a couple of reasons why I avoid doing this, and why the places that I stayed at below, are registered as hotels.

The first is that although in 95% of cases you can rent an Airbnb or equivalent for less than 30 days without issue, in the other 5% (I made up those numbers) you will run into problems. That might just be an over-enthusiastic security guard who takes a little financial encouragment to look the other way, or you may find the building management kicking you out.

You won't face any legal repercussions; it is the landlord who is renting to you illegally. But you may well be kicked-out of the building that you're staying at and find yourself homeless.

When I was living in Bangkok, the building I lived at strictly enforced this law. There were signs everywhere, telling short-term renters that they were not welcome and were there illegally, and every year when I renewed my contract with the landlord, getting the juristic office to reactivate my keycard for another year was a massive hassle of them reading over the contract and checking my passport.

I didn't mind it, because as a long-term resident, I didn't want the property to be used as a hotel. But it also highlighted to me the risks of using Airbnb in Thailand.

The Internet is littered with examples of people who rented-out a short-term Airbnb in Thailand, only to find themselves homeless when the building management wouldn't let them stay. <ExternalLink url='https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/zy06ln/did_anyone_go_through_this_guard_didnt_allow_us/'>This is one example</ExternalLink>. There are many more.

The other reason to avoid these illegal rentals, is that if you plan on doing a visa extension in Thailand, you are required to have a TM30. That is a form, completed by owner/manager of the property in which you are staying, reporting that you are staying there. Essentially, the Thai authorities want to know where you stay on every night that you're in the country, and this is how they do that.

If you are staying in a property illegally, then the landlord will not be able to complete this TM30 form, which will subsequently preclude you from getting a visa extension.

A simple work around is to check-into a hostel for one night on the day you go to immigration to get the visa extension, and have them complete the TM30. But it's an added hassle/expense that you will face when renting illegally.

How strictly you choose to abide by this law is up to you. But within reason, I try to operate within the law of the country that I'm in. Below therefore, are the hotels that I stayed at in Bangkok, in the absence of a willingness to stay at Airbnbs.
