----

Welcome to my new favourite place in the world. Fuck you Siem Reap!

I had loved absolutely everything about being a digital nomad up to the point I came to Udon Thani. The seven months prior had given me the most consistent happiness I've known in my life, but within that context I arrived in Udon Thani feeling as down as I had done at any other point as a digital nomad, because I'd firstly injured my ankle, then got sick, then had a really bad hangover after Songkran (alright, I can't really complain about that one). I derive a lot of my happiness from being mobile and active, and when that is inhibited, it can test the resolve of my smile, so arriving in Udon I needed a little boost.

That's exactly what I got.

It's one of the big four cities in Thailand's Isaan region; a region representing about a third of the Thai population, but like anywhere that's not Bangkok, Chiang Mai or somewhere with a beach, it basically gets ignored by tourists. That can either be a very good thing or a very bad thing, and you don't really find out which until you get here.

I knew very little prior to coming here, but was dubious when in the departure lounge for my flight from Bangkok, I spotted four overweight, balding, middle-aged white men, each by themselves sipping a can of beer.

It wasn't even 11am.

The reason that's a concern is Thailand's worst kept secret, the existence of which is continually denied by officials, is its sex tourism. Congregations of balding white men drinking beer in the morning is usually a good indication of that, and seeing four of them in the departure lounge for my flight did make me question what kind of place I was going to. Luckily that fear was misplaced.

I got off the plane, checked-into my room, and wandered around town for several hours without seeing another foreigner. It was an amazingly friendly place. Lots of people came up and talked to me, and everyone just seemed genuinely happy. It was only on inadvertently wandering down Samphan Thamit Alley, ironically nearby to the Pervy clinic, that I was all... _"oh, this is where all the foriengers are."_

There's literally one road (and surrounding area) of bars, and that seems to be where all of the overweight white men spend their time. They're confined to this area, and the rest of the city's lovely.

## Where I stayed

### Jamjuree Home

<MapLink name='10/9 Benchang Rd' url='https://goo.gl/maps/HZyt78p1y2EUtek16' />

<AccommodationTable details={jamjureeHomeDetails} />

The most important thing when you go somewhere is booking the right accommodation. If you're like me and you work from your room, then you're going to be spending a lot of time there, so you need to get it right. And boy did I?

Jamjuree Home is more a homestay than a hotel, although the guests have a segregated area which consists of four rooms and a large, two-floor common area. Udon Thani is a non-touristy city, and I was here in the low season of a post-covid world. That meant for much of my stay I was the only guest. I arrived here having booked a standard bedroom, but the hotel owner, who's one of the sweetest people I've ever met, offered to upgrade me to the family studio that you see in the details above at no extra charge.

I'd say that calling it a studio is being modest. The bedroom is separated from the kitchen by a wall. Surely that makes it a one bedroom. Semantics aside, it's a really, really lovely place.

As well as the owner, there's one member of staff, and they are amazingly considerate. They make an effort to clean the room at times you're out, and at one point I mentioned to the owner that I was going to Loei after Udon, and asked if she knew anything about how/where to get the bus. She didn't.

Not only did she come back ten minutes later having called around the bus companies and having written down the bus times for me, but on the day I checked-out, a week or so later, she did the exact same thing again. All from an off-the-cuff comment I made one day.

Breakfast is included, and this was definitely a highlight for me. When I checked-in the owner asked me about breakfast, and on telling her I was vegan there was no hesitation in saying what food she'd be able to prepare. I never had to mention it again, and each morning she made me a breakfast that consisted of a vegan potato and mushroom soup, a salad, some fruit, a vegan cake, and the fanciest pot of green tea I've ever had.

Having grown tired of the shitty or non-existent cups that hotels provide, by this stage of being a digital nomad I'd bought my own cup that I carried around in my suitcase. As I'd often be staying in rooms with nothing more than a hand towel, I never really cleaned it properly. It was turning green.

Whilst staying here I'd wake up in the morning, have a cup of green tea out of my dirty travel mug, then go down to breakfast and be served the most beautiful pot of green tea you can imagine. It'd be in a glass pot with a glass lid on a glass stand with a glass cup and a glass saucer, and one of those things that you pour the tea through to filter it, which itself has a stand, and its stand has a stand. Prior to staying here, if a tea bag had a string on it I'd think it was posh. I have the same rule for tampons. This took it to a whole other level.

Breakfast was served from 8am to 10:30am each day. Having got into the habit of not eating until lunch prior to coming here, I'd come down at 10:29 after doing my morning yoga, and it was really the perfect way to start the day.

The room was so comfortable, and pretty spacious for what I'm used to. It includes a balcony and a sort of kitchen. No cooking facilities other than a microwave, but a large fridge, a sink, a hot water dispenser and some plates and cutlery, as well as a small table with a couple of chairs.

The common area is huge, especially considering I was the only guest most of the time, and has many other sofas/chairs to sit on, and another balcony. The one downside is the common area isn't air conditioned, so got pretty hot during the daytime, although they did give me a fan for when I was sitting out here coding one day, which made it bearable. The property also has a nice garden which includes some seating. It's a great place to sit until you've stopped sweating after a run.

All of this would make it an amazing place to stay, but perhaps the best thing about Jamjuree Home is the location. You're about a 30-minute walk from the city centre, which puts you in a more local, slightly quieter area, but it's a comfortable walk in for when you do go into town. You have a couple of local 'jay' (vegan) restaurants nearby, as well as a 7-11 and some other convenience stores, and I went to the nearby <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/H1NSMQvBwVb25u6NA'>Fit Gym</ExternalLink> three times during my stay, which is a huge, well-equipped but not very well attended gym that costs just 160 baht for a day pass. The crown jewel of Udon Thani though, is Nong Prajak Park, which is just a short walk from Jamjuree Home.

Nong Prajak Park is more a lake than a park, but it has a cycle path and separated running track all the way around its 3.1km circumference. It's the perfect place to come for a run or a walk when you need exercise, or it's nice to just come and sit by the water. Having it so nearby is the cherry on top.

### Phattharasaya Home

In the first iteration of this article after my first stay in Udon, I proclaimed it 'my new favourite place in the world,' although I went onto stress that in large part I loved it so much because of my accommodation. So it was with dismay that Jamjuree Home, the accommodation for my first stay, was fully-booked when I made plans to return.

I struggled so much to find an adequate replacement that I considered changing my itinerary to skip Udon Thani altogether, although eventually I opted to take a chance on the brand new Phattharasaya Home, and this was a blessing in disguise as it gave me a very different, but equally satisfying perspective of Udon.

The service is far less personal. There are no ever-present staff at the apartment, so you have to message the manager to let her know of your arrival time so she can meet you there. That anonymity's not always a bad thing though. I'm a very private person so hate the feeling of people knowing my business, like when and how often I go out. Here there are no worries.

Only twice during my sixteen-night stay did anyone enter my room, when the maid came around to clean, and on both occasions I was given 24 hours notice. That's my kind of service.

I was either the first, or one of the first people to stay in this particular apartment (there are six apartments here altogether). I know this because loads of the stuff still had plastic packaging on it, including the TV which I had the privilege of unwrapping. While there is some comfort in knowing everything is brand new, I tend to prefer staying somewhere that's a little more worn-in, and that proved true as there had definitely been some shoddy workmaship putting this room together.

For example, when I sat on one of the bar stools for the first time, a screw dropped-out the bottom. I did my best to replace it, but lacking a screwdriver I didn't do a very good job. Or on the two-tiered coffee table, the second tier is only attached to two of the legs, meaning that if you put anything on one of the opposing corners, it just tips-up. Someone was cutting corners and rushing through when they put that together. Or the most frustrating was that the water pressure for both the sinks (kitchen and bathroom) is diabolical; you get nothing but a dribble out of each of the taps. I checked that the shut-off valves were fully open so initially concluded that being up on the fourth (top) floor of this building, the water pressure was just weak. Yet seeing as the shower, the toilet, and the tap on the balcony all have perfectly adequate water pressure, I too put this down to some questionable workmanship. And while these discrepancies would have driven me crazy had I rented this room long-term, for a two-week stay I just learned to live with them.

Need to fill-up a pan with water? Put it in the sink, turn on the tap, go and do something else for two minutes and come back. I've only got one arse, why do I need two bar stools? I'll just sit on the one that isn't about to collapse.

Once I'd understood and learned to work around the shortcomings, the apartment is actually very well equipped. The sofa's really comfortable. Too comfortable actually, I spent way too much time there, using it to code, and to watch TV on. I believe it doubles as a sofa bed although I never had to check, and having cup holders in the arms of the sofa? Why don't all sofas have them, that's a genius move?

The room's wifi is really fast and reliable; I had absolutely no connection issues here, and... there's a TV. The picture quality is adequate, that sound quality is dog shit. I had to connect my headphones to my Apple TV anytime I watched anything. Perhaps the best thing about this room though?

I long for natural light. I think blackout curtains are a curse on the world, and love nothing more than waking-up with the sun on my face. Being up on the fourth floor, I could comfortably leave the curtains open, closing only the drapes, without worry of people seeing in, and as the room faces east, the sun is so bright in the mornings.

Every morning here I got woken-up by sunshine, which is such a good way to start the day. Anyone who uses blackout curtains, I just hate you. You're a scourge on society.

On the ground floor of the building is a laundry room, accessible with your key card, but heed these warnings:

You know how people feel the need to put technology in places where it's really not needed? Toasters with bluetooth, that kind of thing. Well this laundry room is a fine example, as rather than accepting coins or tokens to operate the machines, they have little touch-screen computers on the front. Touch this screen and a QR code appears, which you can scan with your banking app if, and only if, you have a Thai bank account.

I do, from my time living in Bangkok, but if you're here as a tourist and don't have a local account, then sorry, you can't use the washing machine here.

Why is that better than just taking coins?

Anyway, you scan this QR code and pay through your banking app, the machine (eventually) receives confirmation of your payment and starts all by itself. Yep, you have absolutely no say in the settings, they're all decided for you and you can't change them. For the washer, that's a cold wash without much spinning so your clothes will be not very clean and dripping wet when the cycle's finished.

There are two washers and one dryer. Luckily as no one else was able to actually use these machines I didn't have competition for the dryer on the two times I did my laundry here, but the only reason... the only reason you would use this laundry room is for the convenience of having it in the building.

Each of the machines is 50 baht; if you're willing to walk to one of the nearby self-serve launderettes, you'll pay 20 baht, or you can get your clothes done in a service wash for not much more than you'll pay for the cold cycle and dryer here. So take having a laundry room in the building with a pinch of salt.

The location of the apartment is down a side road off a side road, so is very local, but you're only a five minute walk from a 7-11 and loads of other businesses. Central shopping mall, which marks the centre of Udon, is about a 15 minute walk away, with the train station and UD Town being a similar distance. Nong Bua Public Park is a little further (you have to figure-out where to cross the railway tracks), and in the other direction, Nong Sim Park is even closer.

The location is actually really perfect. You're far enough from the town centre that you're away from the small foreigner area and you feel like you're staying in a local area. But you're also close enough that you're only a fifteen minute walk from the bars if you do feel like going out.

Most people in Udon (and Thailand) use a motorcycle to get around, but I'm someone who loves to walk everywhere. On arriving at Phattharasaya Home I noted that between the apartment and the main road there was a pack of soi dogs that seemed very passive as I encountered them during the daytime. Dogs have a tendency to get more aggressive after dark, so after my first night out back in Udon, I had a bit of a concern walking back in the middle of the night. I needn't have been worried though, these dogs are largely docile. Just be aware that the street isn't that well lit and they tend to sit in the darkest spots, and give them a wide berth when you walk by to avoid being seen as aggressive, and they'll leave you alone.

I also saw a snake walking back one day, but that seemed pretty passive too. The animals are friendly in Udon.

I was walking, the snake wasn't walking.

Phattharasaya Home is still very new, and I'd say it's still going through some growing pains, but I really loved my stay. I would have no qualms with staying here again. It's a comfortable, fully-equipped apartment, at a very fair rate for a short-term stay.

## Where to get vegan food in Udon Thani

If there's one criticism I could level at Udon Thani, this would be it. While there is _some_ vegan food available here, it lacks in variety.

I love Thai food as much as the next man. That's a lie, I think Thai food's very overrated, but Thai people get upset when I say that. It's something that I like to eat sometimes. It's not something that I like to eat all the time.

What I found in Udon is that there's only one restaurant for non-Thai vegan food: Primani's.

### Primani's

Because this was the only place I found in Udon to get non-Thai vegan food, I ate here more than the quality justifies, including getting delivery off FoodPanda a couple of times. That doesn't mean it's a bad place, but it won't blow you away either.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very curious. It feels kind of like eating in a library, and despite music playing I'd see people come in and start whispering to each other. I'm not sure how they managed to cultivate such an atmosphere.

The menu consists of four curries that are natively vegan, and one more that can be made vegan. These aren't marked on the menu, but the owner speaks fluent English and understands what vegan means, so just ask about anything you're unsure of. The quality is decent, and you can expect to pay around 250 baht for a curry, some rice, a chapati and a bottle of water.

### Zing Zing Che

Being the closest vegan restaurant to where I was staying, I came here a few times. It's a typical point-and-hope local family run 'jay' buffet, although they also have a menu on the wall that's translated into English.

No one here speaks a word of English, but you can get by pointing at the buffet if you lack the Thai to communicate. As always with this kind of place, the buffet's a bit hit-and-miss. Some things on offer tasted amazing, others less so, but it's very cheap, so you can afford a few misses.

Entirely unrelated to Zing Zing Che, but often located very nearby is a vegan dessert vendor selling some deep fried goodies. I got a plateful of desserts from her for 35 baht, so I definitely recommend paying here a visit if she's around when you come here.

### Maeya

I didn't really like Maeya. At which point you may be thinking _"well why are you including it in your recommended restaurants then?"_ And that is a good question.

It's because it's easy.

Unlike other restaurants in Udon, it's reliably open at the times it's supposed to be, the menu is translated into English, and vegan options are clearly marked. So when you want to go somewhere, know exactly what you're ordering, and be able to just point at the menu, this is it.

It's a bit of a mill, in that they just churn-out food with little regard for the experience or the service. What I mean is that one person takes your order, another brings you one dish, another the next, someone else the bill etc. It's not personal. Someone will put a plate down in front of you without saying much, and you'll never see them again.

It's not a place to come for the atmosphere, but the food is mostly good. I got one dish (vegan fried wanton in gravy sauce) that was absolutely foul, mainly because the gravy was this horrible gloop that felt and tasted nothing like what I think of gravy as. Everything else was decent.

It's the kind of restaurant where, were I in a place of vegan abundance like Bangkok, I wouldn't give it a second look. As it is, I came here multiple times just because of how barren Udon is for vegans.

## Where to run in Udon Thani

I saw other places that looked viable for running in Udon, but none as good as Nong Prajak Park, and as I was staying so nearby, this is where I went for all five of my runs here.

It's a lake with a 3.1km circumference that has a running track and separated cycling track all the way around it. In the evenings it gets quite crowded, but come here in the daytime and you'll have the whole thing to yourself. It got consistently to 40°C at lunchtime while I was here, and for some reason other people don't like running then. But if you're like me and enjoy saunas and want to work on your tan at the same time, it's perfect.

You don't get much shade. I'd arrived here was a bad ankle and a fever, and running with no shade on a bad ankle with a fever in 40°C is a great way to test your mettle and find out what you're made of.

Turns out I'm not made of very much as I only made it two laps, but it's still an absolutely lovely place to run. I would highly recommend finding somewhere to stay that's nearby when coming to Udon. Definitely the highlight of the city for me.

## Being sociable in Udon Thani

I found no pre-organised events to attend in Udon, so if you're here alone and you want to go out, you're more or less limited to wandering to the town centre and finding a bar. I did that twice and had a surprising amount of fun.

What I realised is that some people I'd met on that first night out, I also saw in completely separate bars on that second night out. There's a community of expats in Udon, many of whom are married to locals, who seem to go around all the bars and drink everyday.

The only bars I found were all on or around Samphan Thamit Alley, which is a fairly long road lined with bars with one complex of even more bars at the north end, and another complex a short walk from the south end.

These bars are aimed entirely at foreigners, so many have hostesses, but there are also normal bars. Most close at midnight but as I found the hard way, if you wander around this area you'll be able to find somewhere that'll serve you alcohol for as long as you can keep drinking it.

That's the hangover sorted then.
