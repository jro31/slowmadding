I really don't have a bad word to say about Phuhunsa - this is my kind of hotel.

Firstly, not only is the room big, but more importantly they haven't filled it with all kinds of useless crap. That's lots of empty space in the room so you don't have to rearrange the furniture to do a workout in the morning. It also has big windows that let-in a tonne of natural light. Unfortunately all rooms at this hotel face west, so you don't get to wake up with the sun on your face, but still, you can't complain when this much light gets in.

All rooms have a decent-sized balcony, with seating, that look over the pool, which I kept on meaning to swim in, but never got around to it. There's was also a desk with chair in the room, which was good for video calls, the bed was perfectly comfortable for working from, and a not quite so comfortable sofa that was better than nothing when you wanted a change.

Something else that I loved about being here, was that the reception was off in this little side building, meaning tha you don't have to walk past the reception desk everytime you go out. That can drive me crazy sometimes, when I just want to go out to 7-11 to buy some soy milk, but the receptionist insists on trying to make small talk with you both when you leave, and when you come back again five minutes later.


Here it's not a problem. No one tries to talk to you, which is exactly what I look for.

The hotel is located a very short walk from the night market which includes all kinds of food. Imporantly from my perspective, there are a couple of vendors that setup there selling pre-cut fruit, and there's also a fruit shop on the same street that's open all day. The nearest 7-11 is about a five-minute walk from the hotel, the nearest launderette is about ten minutes away, and it takes about fifteen minutes to walk to the stadium.

The wifi was fast and 99% reliable during my stay. It got occasionally patchy on a couple of occasions, but that's to be expected anywhere here I think. It never got bad to the point that I couldn't complete a video call.

I don't really have anything negative to add - I thought this was a great place to stay, and I'd happily come back again when I'm next in Nan.
