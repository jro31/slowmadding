## Where to run in Nan

I only found two good places for running in Nan, and they're both the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/eukfzwSwaTvz1ibk6'>Nan Provincial Sport Stadium</ExternalLink>.

Inside the stadium itself is a 400m running track that's open to the public. I ran here one time when doing a fast 5k. It was great for the first couple of laps, and then about 30 young people showed up, supervised by a couple of adults, and started getting in a way a bit, but it was still alright. Serves me right for coming here on a Sunday morning I guess.

More popular with walkers and runners, is the dedicated path that goes around the outside of the stadium grounds. One lap of this measures 1.22km, and it's less mundane and more enjoyable than running on the track, unless you're doing a fast run. Although worth noting that I came here on a weekday lunchtime one day, and there were kids everywhere. I'm unsure where from - there must be a school either on the ground or nearby.

And to be fair, they weren't really on the path at all and they completely left me alone, which wasn't always the case when I walked past other schools in Nan, given the scarcity of foreigners here, so that shouldn't put you off, but something to be aware of.

The stadium is open from 4am to 9pm everyday, and the walk here does start to feel a little bit rural, so it's actually quite pleasant.

I didn't really go anywhere else in Nan that I'd describe as good for running, but the riverside might be another option - I never made it there.

I really don't have a bad word to say about Phuhunsa - this is my kind of hotel.

Firstly, not only is the room big, but more importantly they haven't filled it with all kinds of useless crap. That's lots of empty space in the room so you don't have to rearrange the furniture to do a workout in the morning. It also has big windows that let-in a tonne of natural light. Unfortunately all rooms at this hotel face west, so you don't get to wake up with the sun on your face, but still, you can't complain when this much light gets in.

All rooms have a decent-sized balcony, with seating, that look over the pool, which I kept on meaning to swim in, but never got around to it. There's was also a desk with chair in the room, which was good for video calls, the bed was perfectly comfortable for working from, and a not quite so comfortable sofa that was better than nothing when you wanted a change.

Something else that I loved about being here, was that the reception was off in this little side building, meaning tha you don't have to walk past the reception desk everytime you go out. That can drive me crazy sometimes, when I just want to go out to 7-11 to buy some soy milk, but the receptionist insists on trying to make small talk with you both when you leave, and when you come back again five minutes later.


Here it's not a problem. No one tries to talk to you, which is exactly what I look for.

The hotel is located a very short walk from the night market which includes all kinds of food. Imporantly from my perspective, there are a couple of vendors that setup there selling pre-cut fruit, and there's also a fruit shop on the same street that's open all day. The nearest 7-11 is about a five-minute walk from the hotel, the nearest launderette is about ten minutes away, and it takes about fifteen minutes to walk to the stadium.

The wifi was fast and 99% reliable during my stay. It got occasionally patchy on a couple of occasions, but that's to be expected anywhere here I think. It never got bad to the point that I couldn't complete a video call.

I don't really have anything negative to add - I thought this was a great place to stay, and I'd happily come back again when I'm next in Nan.
