## Where to run in Nan

I only found two good places for running in Nan, and they're both the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/eukfzwSwaTvz1ibk6'>Nan Provincial Sport Stadium</ExternalLink>.

Inside the stadium itself is a 400m running track that's open to the public. I ran here one time when doing a fast 5k. It was great for the first couple of laps, and then about 30 young people showed up, supervised by a couple of adults, and started getting in a way a bit, but it was still alright. Serves me right for coming here on a Sunday morning I guess.

More popular with walkers and runners, is the dedicated path that goes around the outside of the stadium grounds. One lap of this measures 1.22km, and it's less mundane and more enjoyable than running on the track, unless you're doing a fast run. Although worth noting that I came here on a weekday lunchtime one day, and there were kids everywhere. I'm unsure where from - there must be a school either on the ground or nearby.

And to be fair, they weren't really on the path at all and they completely left me alone, which wasn't always the case when I walked past other schools in Nan, given the scarcity of foreigners here, so that shouldn't put you off, but something to be aware of.

The stadium is open from 4am to 9pm everyday, and the walk here does start to feel a little bit rural, so it's actually quite pleasant.

I didn't really go anywhere else in Nan that I'd describe as good for running, but the riverside might be another option - I never made it there.

## Getting vegan food in Nan

Nan isn't immediately a very vegan-friendly place - you have to figure-out where you can eat here. As I typically eat only one meal per day, apart from my morning and evening smoothies, I'm just going to detail every meal I ate here, and hopefully that can help you if you're struggling to find vegan food.

On day 1 I arrived here having been sat on a bus for hours and it was pissing down with rain, so I couldn't be arsed to go exploring. Instead I just had a couple of the vegan frozen meals from 7-11, so we'll ignore day 1.

On day 2 I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/tv6HdEuPuAwxPDeh9'>Khao Soi Luke Jan</ExternalLink> which is a meat-serving restaurant with a small vegetarian section (4 items). I got the Khao soi with mushroom and tofu, and forgot to request it be made egg-free (as it says that you should on the menu), so I'm uncertain if the noodles were vegan or not, so make sure you're more awake than I was. The staff here don't really speak English, but the menu is translated into English, so you can point at least.

On day 3 I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/rsZAyXNsRcwBxkJe9'>เฮือนเจ เมืองน่าน</ExternalLink>, which translates roughly to 'vegan house in Nan'. It's a little local 'jay' restaurant where there's no pre-made buffet to point at and there is no menu, you just tell the chef what you want, and she doesn't speak English. Luckily my Thai is at a point that I can get by at places like this now, but if you don't speak any, this will be an awkward place to order at. I got the khao soi. It was rather small, and as there is no menu she can just make-up prices on the spot. I feel like I wouldn't have been charged 80 baht if I was a local, which put me off coming back again.

On day 4 I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/PZmnQ6zYVdbtohH86'>Hot Bread</ExternalLink>. This was the easiest place to get vegan food that I came to in Nan. The menu is in English, and vegetarian items are highlighted green, and the staff speak English. It's priced a little higher than other restaurants, but if you just want a decent selection and an easy meal that you're sure is vegan, come here.

On day 5 I went to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SQ6eqcjQkzzLuWqh9'>Gin Ploen Salad</ExternalLink> which is a little salad shop, near to the stadium. I first noticed them on Grab when I first arrived in Nan, but if ordering on Grab they frustratingly require you to order a non-vegan protein with one of their vegan salads, so I initially gave up, until I stumbled upon their physical premises when scouting-out the stadium. If you come here in person you can order their vegan salads without any protein. On their menu of six salads, three are vegan. Note that none of the sauces are, as they all contain egg, and be aware that the menu is only in Thai, and the staff only speak Thai. I got the fruit salad for 89 baht, and the cereal salad for 69 baht. But despite getting two of them, they still felt a little light, so I had a protein soy milk from 7-11 to go with them.

On day 6 my intention was to go to Nan Artisan Pizza, a pizza shop with a vegan marinara pizza on its menu that I'd discovered on my wanderings. Unfortunately it got updated to 'permanently closed' on Google Maps, and as it was in the opposite direction of where I wanted to go today, I went back to Khao Soi Luke Jan instead, and got a couple more of the items of the vegetarian section of their menu, which were a little uninspiring, but at least they existed.

By day 7, <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/NZ5ZYeGpsx4xYyMN9'>Nan Artisan Pizza</ExternalLink> was no longer permanently closed. I went there and got two slices of the sourdough bread for 120 baht, and the marinara pizza for 99 baht, which is explicitly stated in the menu, in English, as being vegan, which is comforting, right? When my pizza came, there was a very light dusting of what looked like some kind of grated cheese. I couldn't be arsed to make a fuss, so just assumed it was vegan and ate it, even though I'm pretty sure it wasn't. The staff here speak some English, so explicitly tell them that you want it vegan, because otherwise they might decorate your vegan pizza with something non-vegan. Other than that I liked this restaurant.

## Where I stayed in Nan

### Phuhunsa Boutique Hotel

I really don't have a bad word to say about Phuhunsa - this is my kind of hotel.

Firstly, not only is the room big, but more importantly they haven't filled it with all kinds of useless crap. That's lots of empty space in the room so you don't have to rearrange the furniture to do a workout in the morning. It also has big windows that let-in a tonne of natural light. Unfortunately all rooms at this hotel face west, so you don't get to wake up with the sun on your face, but still, you can't complain when this much light gets in.

All rooms have a decent-sized balcony, with seating, that look over the pool, which I kept on meaning to swim in, but never got around to it. There's was also a desk with chair in the room, which was good for video calls, the bed was perfectly comfortable for working from, and a not quite so comfortable sofa that was better than nothing when you wanted a change.

Something else that I loved about being here, was that the reception was off in this little side building, meaning tha you don't have to walk past the reception desk everytime you go out. That can drive me crazy sometimes, when I just want to go out to 7-11 to buy some soy milk, but the receptionist insists on trying to make small talk with you both when you leave, and when you come back again five minutes later.


Here it's not a problem. No one tries to talk to you, which is exactly what I look for.

The hotel is located a very short walk from the night market which includes all kinds of food. Imporantly from my perspective, there are a couple of vendors that setup there selling pre-cut fruit, and there's also a fruit shop on the same street that's open all day. The nearest 7-11 is about a five-minute walk from the hotel, the nearest launderette is about ten minutes away, and it takes about fifteen minutes to walk to the stadium.

The wifi was fast and 99% reliable during my stay. It got occasionally patchy on a couple of occasions, but that's to be expected anywhere here I think. It never got bad to the point that I couldn't complete a video call.

I don't really have anything negative to add - I thought this was a great place to stay, and I'd happily come back again when I'm next in Nan.
