A couple of years ago at the weekly running club I used to go to when I was living in London, during a conversation someone said to me that _"you're lucky, you're naturally good at running."_

That kind of pissed me off. This was more of a drinking club that went for a run first than a serious running club, so the standard was fairly low, and on that basis I was always one of the faster runners, but it annoyed me that was thought of as a natural gift. By the time I joined this running club I'd been running for about eighteen years, and what my peers didn't see was the overweight teenager from eighteen years earlier who got so tired he'd have to take a break walking up a flight of stairs, and who would be breathless running for a bus.

I have no natural talent for running, if anything I'm the opposite, but eighteen years earlier I'd set myself on a path to leave behind overweight, unfit boy who'd defined my teenage years, and to never return to him, and this was the outcome.

I think it's human nature that we rarely consider what a person when through to get to where they are, and assume that they just started at the moment we first saw them. I never really considered that my grandparents had seventy years of life before I met them, to me they were always just old and there.

I feel a similar level of disrespect when it comes to being a digital nomad. I work two days per week and live very comfortably of the income that generates while spending my days moving around and seeing the world.

I will not deny it is a great life, but it is always an annoyance when people inquire about what I do and how I do it, and when I respond they tell me how lucky I am. Little do they know that to get to this position was a years-long process full of stress and sacrifice, with the specific intent of getting exactly where I am. Luck had little to do with it.
