A couple of years ago at the weekly running club I used to go to when I was living in London, during a conversation someone said to me that _"you're lucky, you're naturally good at running."_

That kind of pissed me off. This was more of a drinking club that went for a run first than a serious running club, so the standard was fairly low, and on that basis I was always one of the faster runners, but it annoyed me that was thought of as a natural gift. By the time I joined this running club I'd been running for about eighteen years, and what my peers didn't see was the overweight teenager from eighteen years earlier who got so tired he'd have to take a break walking up a flight of stairs, and who would be breathless running for a bus.

I have no natural talent for running, if anything I'm the opposite, but eighteen years earlier I'd set myself on a path to leave behind overweight, unfit boy who'd defined my teenage years, and to never return to him, and this was the outcome.

I think it's human nature that we rarely consider what a person when through to get to where they are, and assume that they just started at the moment we first saw them. I never really considered that my grandparents had seventy years of life before I met them, to me they were always just old and there.

I feel a similar level of disrespect when it comes to being a digital nomad. I work two days per week and live very comfortably of the income that generates while spending my days moving around and seeing the world.

I will not deny it is a great life, but it is always an annoyance when people inquire about what I do and how I do it, and when I respond they tell me how lucky I am. Little do they know that to get to this position was a years-long process full of stress and sacrifice, with the specific intent of getting exactly where I am. Luck had little to do with it.

This is my story of how I went from being an English teacher, working six day per week, to where I am now.

## Background

To understand what I did and why I did it, it'll help to understand exactly where I was in life, so I want to go back to 2017.

I'd been living abroad in some capacity since 2008. It had started as a backpacking trip, but by 2012 I was tired of backpacking.

Moving from hostel to hostel, lacking privacy or stability, being a tourist everywhere I went, I'd just had enough of it, but I didn't really want to go back home to London either. I wanted a way to continue seeing the world, but with a little more permanence everywhere I went, and my solution was to use the most underappreciated skill I'd been blessed with being from the UK, of being a native English speaker.

I became an English teacher with the expectation of moving somewhere new every six months or so, but I've so often experienced, once I find comfort and familiarity it's hard to let it go. Instead of moving every six months, I ended up living in Bangkok for almost two years, then moving to China, then by 2017 I'd been back in Bangkok for two years again. After five years of teaching English I'd only lived in two different cities.

The problem was I loved it. I really liked my life in Bangkok. By western standards my salary was paltry, but in Bangkok it was about three times the local average, so I lived a very comfortable lifestyle, eating well, exercising a lot, and I found teaching a really fulfilling job.

I only ever taught adults, and there was something very satisfying about knowing you're helping people and passing-on knowledge. I could have perhaps done this job forever, but if I didn't change something, I might have had to and that was the part that scared me.

There was a very evident shift in the landscape for foreign English teachers. Demand, particularly from adults to learn in in-person classes was waning. More and more adults knew English by now, and more and more teaching was being done online. The minimum age of students at my school was getting lower as they attempted to make-up for this lack of demand. Then the school started talking about having to let teachers go because there weren't enough classes.

It felt that the writing was on the wall for English teaching overall as a profession, where with some adaptation to teaching kids and to moving online, I probably could have scraped an income the rest of my working life, but really wasn't what I was looking for, and I'd seen first-hand the dangers of becoming _too_ comfortable.

When you earn three times the local average, live comfortably, enjoy your job, love your city, and have no discernible skills that will be useful in your home country, then it's very hard to find the motivation to leave that job. Why would you?

Well if you're in Bangkok as an English teacher, you're there on a year-long working visa that gets extended every year. Do you know what that means?

If you ever leave the job, then you also lose the visa and the right to live in the country. If you want to stay in Thailand, you have to stay in the job, or at least find a new one.

That might be possible if you're young and fresh, but who's going to hire a teacher in their fifties, sixties, seventies, or even eighties?

You may be living comfortably in Thailand, but during this time you're not saving much either, not by western standards, you're not making enough to pay into a pension, and you're not paying any national insurance or social security in your home country, so you have no access to a state pension, you have no private pension and no savings. How are you going to retire?

Short answer: You're not.

You cannot afford to go back to your home country, and you can only stay in Thailand so long as you continue working, so what happens?

You have to continue working. Until you die.

My school in Bangkok was founded in 1952, and within its walls you saw teachers on all stages of this timeline. You had the young, fresh-faced teachers in their twenties, just here for a bit of an experience and some time abroad.

You had the ones in their forties who'd started as that twenty years earlier, got too comfortable and stayed, and now had nowhere else to go, but were still young enough that they weren't quite worrying.

You had the ones in their fifties and sixties who were panicking because they now knew they were unlikely to get a teaching job elsewhere but who couldn't go back to their home country so were working as much overtime as they could to save up as much money as they could in a futile attempt to one day be able to aford retirement.

Then at the very end of the spectrum you had the teachers in their seventies and eighties. There was one very sweet old lady, pretty much deaf and not entirely balanced, but had been at the school for over forty years and, for reasons I've given above, couldn't retire so was still working at 84. Another guy in his mid-seventies, phoned in sick for work one day. Three days later he was dead.

In 2017 I was 32, and by looking around in the staff-room could see my future, and it scared me. It scared me enough that I was willing to give-up this job that I enjoyed, living in a city I loved on three-times the average wage. For what? What was going to replace this?

At this point I didn't know, but with no transferable skills and no other meaningful experience, it was very evident that my life was going to get worse before it got better, yet to avoid this future it was a sacrifice worth making. In order to prepare myself, I gave myself one year.

Each year I was a teacher I went back to the UK to visit my family, and on this visit in the summer of 2017 I told myself that at this point in 2018, you need to resign from your job as an English teacher. That gives you one year to try things and to figure-out what you want to do, but for better or worse, at this time next year you resign from your job and the life that you love, no matter what.

At 33 I would be young enough to change career and to be given a shot in something new, but would that still be the case at 40? Who's going to hire a forty year-old with no experience? It has to be now.

So that was how my journey to become a digital nomad started. I had spent most of my adult life travelling and living abroad and I didn't want that to stop, so I was intent on learning a skill, like English, that was in demand all over the world. And it had to be something that I enjoyed, it had to be something that I was good at, and I had one year to find it.

## TODO

Throughout my time travelling I kept a journal that by this point was well over three million words. I loved writing, and so my first instinct was to become a writer.

I wanted as much independence as possible, and with the advent of ebooks, self-publishing was a possiblity, so why don't I become a novelist? That was the first thing I tried in this year to find myself. I started writing my first novel.

An average book is about 80,000 words and I'd been known to type more than 10,000 words in a single sitting while writing my journal, so my first novel should take me little over a week.

Turns-out it's not that easy. I got about 5,000 words in before I realised I'd run-out of things to say. I'd introduced some characters and done some setup, and I'd been hoping my mind would write the rest of the story as I went. That's how I'm writing this article, every other article on this site and the three million words of my journal. I don't know what I'm going to say, I just sit here, let my mind tell my fingers what to type while I look at the ceiling, and then once it's finished read it over and I'm like 'oh, very nice.'

I guess that strategy doesn't work with novels, so I gave up on being a novelist. Somewhere I still have those 5,000 words saved, so maybe I'll go back to my novel one day and finish it off.

I flirted with a couple of other ideas, but the one thing that was really tickling me was learning to code. It ticked all the boxes.

It's an in demand skill, something that can be done remotely and as a freelance, it pays well, and I think I'll be good at it. The basis for such confidence was that I've always been very organised and meticulous, and that I love logic-based problems. I enjoy a Sudoku, and I can play Tetris for hours.

Apart from some basic HTML and CSS I'd never coded, but I felt I had the right aptitude for it, I just needed to find out.

The problem I had was the only computer I owned was a six year-old £300 Windows laptop that I had to turn-on about twenty minutes before I used it, just to let it warm-up, and this wasn't going to be suitable to learn to code on. Just to explore this pipe-dream of coding, I was going to need to upgrade to a MacBook, costing in the region of £1,400, which way more than my monthly salary at this point.

Were I to give-up on coding as quickly as I had novelling, it would prove a costly adventure, but it felt like an itch I had to scratch, so after weeks of deliberation, I went down to the Emporium shopping mall in Bangkok and invested in my first MacBook. This was the first step to becoming a software developer.

At this stage in the Apple ecosystem, iPhone apps were still a viable option for a lone developer to make a living from. That's a lot less true today as apps have become more advanced, so must the teams behind them. But at this moment, there were apps that I thought should exist that just didn't. They still don't really to this day.

I'd posted my ideas on a forum that exist for people to post their app ideas, but no one had picked them up, and after years of frustration just went fuck it, I'll make these apps myself then. So my initial intention was to learn to make iPhone apps, and to do that I wanted to learn Swift.

That is a programming language written by Apple for use on its devices, so I went onto Udemy, found a course to learn Swift, and I dove right in. And I immediately loved it.

It certainly wasn't without frustration, as I tried to wrap my head around this entirely new concept of writing computer programs, but the frustration was countered by an ecstasy whenever I fixed a bug that once seemed impossible.

This course was made-up of video guides, but between each module they set you a challenge to build something, where there was no guide.

I still remember the joy of getting my very first application, and hangman game, written from start to finish, all by myself.

That may sound trivial today, but having never programmed a thing a few weeks earlier, it meant a lot to me.

I was loving learning to code. I did it alongside working full-time as an English teacher, but one thing I've learned over the years is that no goal is ever as straight forward as you think it'll be.

TODO: Add cartoon here?

At that time I had a great manager at work. He was loved by everyone, and really tried to make everyone feel comfortable at the school, accommodating people as best he could. The problem was that this branch of the school that I worked at was also the head office. There were subsidiaries all over Thailand, but this was the head office, meaning that at any other branch, if you were the manager you had the freedom to manage as you saw fit. At this branch you had people questioning everything you did and peering over you at all times, hence such a high turnover of managers, and a lack of demand from other managers in the network to take this role, despite the perceived prestige of managing the main branch.

This manager that everyone loved, left to return to a subsidiary branch, and his replacement was the opposite.

I never understood his motivation, but he seemed intent on making everyone's lives as difficult as possible, just to assert his authority. We'd gone from having a guy who'd make the schedule as kind as possible with as many repeat-classes as possible so that you had less planning to do, with a guy, who just did the opposite.

He'd give you split shifts, with a class in the morning and one in the evening, and when you'd question why you couldn't instead have classes next to each other, he'd reply that he was the boss so he'd decide how to do things.

The guy was a prick.

The relevance to this story, was under my previous manager, I was finding the time almost every day to learn coding. Under this new guy, I was lucky to find an hour a week, and was forgetting more than I was learning, which put me in an awkward predicament.

If I'm not able to learn coding while being an English teacher, then I've got one of two options. I either forget about coding, and focus on teaching English. Or I stop teaching English and I focus on coding.

To look back on it now, this guy's emergence was a blessing in disguise. By now it was around Easter, only two or three months before I'd promised myself the summer before, that I'd quit this job no matter what. And while I was comfortably teaching English while learning to code on the side, I might have been tempted to extend this deadline, I no longer had that luxury. I had to make a decision.

I wrestled with it for the next term, still unsure of my future. An innocuous comment to one of my fellow teachers one day led to her sending me an article about coding bootcamps that would ultimately change my life, as I hadn't even considered a bootcamp up until now. And when it came to the end of term, and time for my annual visit to London, I emptied my locker just in case.

It was a strange feeling as I walked out the school that day. I'd been there for three years and I walked-out, not knowing if I'd return.

Going back to London was useful, not only to gain some perspective, but Le Wagon, the coding bootcamp I'd been most impressed with had a London campus, so I went down there one day and spent a while speaking to some of the teachers and some of the students.

This was the push I needed. This visit was what convinced me.

These bootcamps aren't cheap. At this moment, a spot at the Le Wagon bootcamp was around £5,000, which is a lot of money. For that much, I could travel to a dark corner of a cheap country and live for six months quite comfortably. Could I learn more self-teaching for six months instead?

While learning to code while working as a full-time teacher, I could take my time, but if I was going to rob myself on my income, then I needed to find myself earning as a software engineer in the most economically-efficient manner possible. I would have until my savings ran dry to get a job, and should I fail I'd need to scramble for any income I could find just to survive, potentially rendering my dream of making a living from coding, dead.

What I did do at this moment, was make the decision that I wasn't going back to be a teacher. I emailed my resignation to my school in Bangkok, and made the commitment that I was going to commit to coding, 100%.

While I'd quit my job, I still had my condo in Bangkok, to which I'd need to return in order to move-out. And seeing as I'd be going to Asia anyway, would I be better attending a bootcamp in Asia?

Over the space of two or three weeks in this summer, I made some decisions that would forever change my life, ending my career as an English teacher, and eventually deciding that the cost of the Le Wagon bootcamp would be a worthwhile investment, and why not do it in Bali? Living by the beach will sure as Hell beat a daily commute in winter to the campus in London.
