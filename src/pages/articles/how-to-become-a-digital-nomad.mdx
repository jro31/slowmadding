A couple of years ago at the weekly running club I used to go to when I was living in London, during a conversation someone said to me that _"you're lucky, you're naturally good at running."_

That kind of pissed me off. This was more of a drinking club that went for a run first than a serious running club, so the standard was fairly low, and on that basis I was always one of the faster runners, but it annoyed me that was thought of as a natural gift. By the time I joined this running club I'd been running for about eighteen years, and what my peers didn't see was the overweight teenager from eighteen years earlier who got so tired he'd have to take a break walking up a flight of stairs, and who would be breathless running for a bus.

I have no natural talent for running, if anything I'm the opposite, but eighteen years earlier I'd set myself on a path to leave behind overweight, unfit boy who'd defined my teenage years, and to never return to him, and this was the outcome.

I think it's human nature that we rarely consider what a person when through to get to where they are, and assume that they just started at the moment we first saw them. I never really considered that my grandparents had seventy years of life before I met them, to me they were always just old and there.

I feel a similar level of disrespect when it comes to being a digital nomad. I work two days per week and live very comfortably of the income that generates while spending my days moving around and seeing the world.

I will not deny it is a great life, but it is always an annoyance when people inquire about what I do and how I do it, and when I respond they tell me how lucky I am. Little do they know that to get to this position was a years-long process full of stress and sacrifice, with the specific intent of getting exactly where I am. Luck had little to do with it.

This is my story of how I went from being an English teacher, working six day per week, to where I am now.

## Background

To understand what I did and why I did it, it'll help to understand exactly where I was in life, so I want to go back to 2017.

I'd been living abroad in some capacity since 2008. It had started as a backpacking trip, but by 2012 I was tired of backpacking.

Moving from hostel to hostel, lacking privacy or stability, being a tourist everywhere I went, I'd just had enough of it, but I didn't really want to go back home to London either. I wanted a way to continue seeing the world, but with a little more permanence everywhere I went, and my solution was to use the most underappreciated skill I'd been blessed with being from the UK, of being a native English speaker.

I became an English teacher with the expectation of moving somewhere new every six months or so, but I've so often experienced, once I find comfort and familiarity it's hard to let it go. Instead of moving every six months, I ended up living in Bangkok for almost two years, then moving to China, then by 2017 I'd been back in Bangkok for two years again. After five years of teaching English I'd only lived in two different cities.

The problem was I loved it. I really liked my life in Bangkok. By western standards my salary was paltry, but in Bangkok it was about three times the local average, so I lived a very comfortable lifestyle, eating well, exercising a lot, and I found teaching a really fulfilling job.

I only ever taught adults, and there was something very satisfying about knowing you're helping people and passing-on knowledge. I could have perhaps done this job forever, but if I didn't change something, I might have had to and that was the part that scared me.

There was a very evident shift in the landscape for foreign English teachers. Demand, particularly from adults to learn in in-person classes was waning. More and more adults knew English by now, and more and more teaching was being done online. The minimum age of students at my school was getting lower as they attempted to make-up for this lack of demand. Then the school started talking about having to let teachers go because there weren't enough classes.

It felt that the writing was on the wall for English teaching overall as a profession, where with some adaptation to teaching kids and to moving online, I probably could have scraped an income the rest of my working life, but really wasn't what I was looking for, and I'd seen first-hand the dangers of becoming _too_ comfortable.

When you earn three times the local average, live comfortably, enjoy your job, love your city, and have no discernible skills that will be useful in your home country, then it's very hard to find the motivation to leave that job. Why would you?

Well if you're in Bangkok as an English teacher, you're there on a year-long working visa that gets extended every year. Do you know what that means?

If you ever leave the job, then you also lose the visa and the right to live in the country. If you want to stay in Thailand, you have to stay in the job, or at least find a new one.

That might be possible if you're young and fresh, but who's going to hire a teacher in their fifties, sixties, seventies, or even eighties?

You may be living comfortably in Thailand, but during this time you're not saving much either, not by western standards, you're not making enough to pay into a pension, and you're not paying any national insurance or social security in your home country, so you have no access to a state pension, you have no private pension and no savings. How are you going to retire?

Short answer: You're not.

You cannot afford to go back to your home country, and you can only stay in Thailand so long as you continue working, so what happens?

You have to continue working. Until you die.

My school in Bangkok was founded in 1952, and within its walls you saw teachers on all stages of this timeline. You had the young, fresh-faced teachers in their twenties, just here for a bit of an experience and some time abroad.

You had the ones in their forties who'd started as that twenty years earlier, got too comfortable and stayed, and now had nowhere else to go, but were still young enough that they weren't quite worrying.

You had the ones in their fifties and sixties who were panicking because they now knew they were unlikely to get a teaching job elsewhere but who couldn't go back to their home country so were working as much overtime as they could to save up as much money as they could in a futile attempt to one day be able to aford retirement.

Then at the very end of the spectrum you had the teachers in their seventies and eighties. There was one very sweet old lady, pretty much deaf and not entirely balanced, but had been at the school for over forty years and, for reasons I've given above, couldn't retire so was still working at 84. Another guy in his mid-seventies, phoned in sick for work one day. Three days later he was dead.

In 2017 I was 32, and by looking around in the staff-room could see my future, and it scared me. It scared me enough that I was willing to give-up this job that I enjoyed, living in a city I loved on three-times the average wage. For what? What was going to replace this?

At this point I didn't know, but with no transferable skills and no other meaningful experience, it was very evident that my life was going to get worse before it got better, yet to avoid this future it was a sacrifice worth making. In order to prepare myself, I gave myself one year.

Each year I was a teacher I went back to the UK to visit my family, and on this visit in the summer of 2017 I told myself that at this point in 2018, you need to resign from your job as an English teacher. That gives you one year to try things and to figure-out what you want to do, but for better or worse, at this time next year you resign from your job and the life that you love, no matter what.

At 33 I would be young enough to change career and to be given a shot in something new, but would that still be the case at 40? Who's going to hire a forty year-old with no experience? It has to be now.

## TODO

So that was how my journey to become a digital nomad started. I had spent most of my adult life travelling and living abroad and I didn't want that to stop, so I was intent on learning a skill, like English, that was in demand all over the world. And it had to be something that I enjoyed, it had to be something that I was good at, and I had one year to find it.
