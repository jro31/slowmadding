When I decided to go from Bangkok to Huahin recently it was a massive ballache to figure-out the quickest/cheapest/safest/best ways to do it because there are so many departure terminals. So here's everything I learned, simplified and all in one place.

I'm not going to cover private transport here. If you plan on hiring a private taxi for the drive, it's going to cost you in the region of 2,000 baht, but that wasn't something I considered so I didn't really look into it. I'm just going to cover buses and train.

## Taking the train from Bangkok to Huahin

Since I last lived in Bangkok, Hua Lamphong has been replaced by Bang Sue Grand Station as Bangkok's main train station. What does that mean? It means that most trains, but not all, now leave from Bang Sue. Just to keep everyone confused, some local, slower services still leave from Hua Lamphong.

The first point of confusion comes on the <ExternalLink url='https://www.railway.co.th/Home/Index'>State Railway of Thailand</ExternalLink> website; that's the official government website for checking train times in Thailand. Once you've figued-out how to get the site in English, you'll see a search box to "Check Train Schedule & Fares".

If you select your origin as Bangkok and your destination as 'Hua hin' (note the space, it won't work without it) then it returns one result; an 'Ordinary' train (that means it's a local, third-class train that makes loads of stops) leaving Bangkok at 09:20 and arriving in Huahin at 14:15. So that's it, right? There's one train per day from Bangkok to Huahin.

Not so fast. What this site fails to make clear is that 'Bangkok' here, means Hua Lamphong station. If you want to search for Bang Sue, you have to search for the not very obvious 'Krung Thep Aphiwat' ('Krung Thep' is how you say Bangkok in Thai). Searching for this returns 11 results, so you actually have way more choice than you might have realised, and all of these trains are about an hour faster than the almost 5 hour journey that's scheduled if you go from Hua Lamphong.

I've always liked taking the train in Thailand, and as Hua Lamphong station was close to where I was staying in Bangkok, but Bang Sue was over the other side of the city, I contemplated taking this slow train from Hua Lamphong. Part of the appeal is that Thailand's roads are notoriously dangerous, so you have a much better chance of survival on the train. Unfortunately experience tells me that Thailand's trains are rarely on time, so a five hour trip is more likely to take seven, and after that amount of time, you can get a numb arse on a third class train. Not wanting to have to go all the way to Bang Sue either, I decided that I'd risk my life on a bus instead.

## Taking a bus from Bangkok to Huahin

If it's not confusing enough that there are two train stations with services to Huahin, there are three bus stations that have services to Huahin. Because of the aforementioned safety concerns, I'd have preferred a big bus (as opposed to a minivan). Sadly I learned that big buses to Huahin only depart from the massively inconvenient Southern bus terminal, and I'd rather die than have to get there. The other two choices were Mo Chit, which is quite close to Bang Sue (so a long way away), or Ekkamai Bus Terminal (also known as the 'Eastern Bus Terminal'), which was near to me, so I opted for that.

Note that, unsurprisingly given the name, this terminal primarily serves eastern locations, as such there's a lot of different services going to Pattaya. There's just one that goes to Huahin, and I think it might be quite new because on my taxi to get there I told the driver I was going to Huahin, and he questioned whether I could even get a bus from there to Huahin. I had to show him a photo I'd taken a few days earlier of the ticket kiosk selling tickets to Huahin when I'd gone there on a scouting trip, just to convince him.

On this scouting trip I'd asked the (unnecessarily unfriendly) woman who works in the kiosk whether I need to buy tickets in advance, or whether I can just rock-up. She told me to come an hour before the bus I planned on taking. I have a Thai friend who regularly makes this journey, and she told me that the times don't mean too much and the buses just leave when they're full. Thankfully, both pieces of advice proved false.

I got stuck in traffic on the way to the bus terminal (surprisingly), so didn't arrive until 10:30am. I asked for a ticket on the 11am bus, and I think I was one of the first to buy one. There was absolutely no need to be there an hour early. The bus did delay for about 10 minutes before leaving, but thankfully it didn't wait until it was full, because less than half the seats were taken. That meant that everybody on board who wanted a double-seat got one.

I'd also been warned that carrying a suitcase as I was, they may charge me more if it doesn't comfortably fit. Again, this proved untrue as there was a space inside the bus for luggage, so it didn't even have to go underneath. There were no extra charges, and the ticket cost 200 baht.

Being a minivan there are obviously no toilets on board, and we made just one very brief (less than 10 minutes) toilet stop a couple of hours into the journey, so don't drink too much liquid before boarding because you'll have to hold it in. There was a small convenience store at this stop if you need any snacks.

As we got into Huahin, the bus stopped and let off locals at various points, but it's worth adding a warning about a potential scam as we got into Huahin.

Quite near the Hilton hotel, which is in the town centre, the bus stopped and the doors opened, and this very friendly guy got on, eyeing any foreigners, asking where they were going and saying he could help them get to their hotels. I wasn't sure at this point if it was the last stop, or if this was going to be the closest stop to where my room was, but my inherent mistrust of fellow humans did me a service as I declined his offer of help and opted to stay on the bus. A German guy that I'd been chatting to for much of the journey didn't, and the last I saw of him as the bus drove away, was this German getting into this man's unmarked car.

I'm he just operates as an unofficial taxi and pays the driver a little kick-back to be able to get on and try and take advantage of any unknowing foreigners on the bus.

Once we were moving again, a local on the bus that I'd been chatting to told me that she had no idea why the bus had stopped there as it wasn't a stop. Instead the bus terminates opposite the Market Village Shopping Mall, <ExternalLink url='https://goo.gl/maps/LnJ3VtmtLDod3A2h8'>roughly here</ExternalLink>.

I was very glad that I'd stayed on, because this was just a five-minute walk from my hotel, and it also let me see where the buses going in the opposite direction depart from (it's on the other side of the road from where you get dropped-off). Had I listened to this suspiciously friendly man who I'd never met, I'd have had to pay a taxi fare to get to my hotel and wouldn't have had any idea where to get back to Bangkok from. So be wary.

It seems a pretty innocuous scam as scams go, but a scam none the less.

If you aren't lucky enough to be walking distance from here, then Grab is always an option, or there's a line of tuk-tuks outside the Market Village Shopping Mall (you'll need to walk over the footbridge that you get dropped-off next to), so you won't be left stranded.
