## Getting vegan food in Skopje

When it comes to getting vegan food, I found Skopje to be a little bit lacking in quality options.

By far the best place to get vegan food is Paradise Food (below). I went there pretty much every other day that I was in Skopje, but beyond that I found it better to cook at home.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SCGNg7VbJvUYaLfFA'>Vegan 365</ExternalLink> _should_ have been my kind of place, being a family-run vegan restaurant with a focus on preventing animal cruelty, yet I found it to continually be so frustrating that I never left happy.

It would be closed on sporadic and seemingly random days. I came here on two occasions when it should have been open, only to find that it wasn't. It's a small restaurant with only four tables, and on one of the four occasions that I did eat here I was sat at alone the smallest table, which can comfortably sit no more than two people. Although other tables were free when I arrived, service was so slow that day (a continual issue) that by the time my food arrived there were no free tables left. Right as I was about to tuck-into my rather messy burger, these two large German women stood over me to ask _"do you mind if we sit here too?"_

There was a much bigger table at the back of the restaurant also occupied by only one person, not to mention free tables outside, so in my head I was thinking _"no, fuck off and let me eat my burger in peace."_ Yet for some reason I have a desire to avoid any kind of conflict, so sheepishly agreed, and had to eat trapped in a corner by these large Germans. I didn't like that they asked in the first place (I did note that a high percentage of the customers here were a bit odd), but I didn't like even more that the staff, who were standing right there, didn't ask them to wait for a free table or to sit outside.

Just because it's a fully-vegan restaurant I came back again, and to avoid the previous issues I picked a quiet time and was the only customer, yet right as my food arrived a woman walked-in with a buggy and a screaming baby. It was plain from the reactions of the staff that this baby was part of the family of this family run restaurant. But they then proceded to change this baby, on one of the restaurant tables. The one right behind me. So I had the both the smell and the incessant crying of a baby being changed one to two metres away from where I was trying to have lunch. I will never, ever return to this restaurant.

Although not vegan, I had a much better experience at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SGindcP4vDMVAQgu8'>Zen Gusto</ExternalLink>. It's basic food, but they have a couple of vegan options on their menu including a vegan feta sandwich.

And as I speak Thai, I wanted to find someone in Skopje to speak Thai with. That was part of my motivation for going to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/uscdEKaZbXK4Hz7z9'>Thai Box</ExternalLink>, although more interesting was that one of the keywords on Google Maps reviews of Thai Box is 'middle finger', in which you'll find three separate reviews of people claiming that the staff gave them the middle finger. That made me want to come here even more, but the staff were lovely, and I chatted to the Thai chef in Thai for a while which made me happy.

Unfortunately the food was a little lacking. I came in and asked for something vegan, When I was offered rice with vegetables, I asked if they had any tofu. They didn't. So it was just rice with vegetables, but at least I got to practice Thai for a bit.
