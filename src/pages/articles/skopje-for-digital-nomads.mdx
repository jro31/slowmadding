## Paying for things in Skopje

The currency used in North Macedonia is the Macedonian denar. Typically prices are just be a number without any currecy symbol next to it, but you might also see the suffix ден, which is the short form of the word 'denar' in Macedonian Cyrillic. In international currency contexts you'll see it shortened to MKD.

In most places the denar is the only currency that's accepted, and that is what you should expect to pay with, but you will encounter Euros on occasion. I was given change in Euros when I took a taxi from the airport, presumably because the taxi driver gets paid in Euros by tourists all the time. And when I bought a bus ticket to Sofia, the bus company didn't accept card payment, but did accept Euros, which was lucky because I didn't have enough denar left.

In 95% of places in Skopje card payment is accepted, but it's one of those frustrating situations where it's not accepted everywhere, so you need to carry cash with you just in case. All big businesses like supermarkets accept card payment, but you'll occasionally go somewhere smaller like a restaurant where only cash is accepted.

When I arrived in Skopje I withdrew 8,000 ден from an ATM in the airport. This lasted me for my entire five-week stay. I didn't need to use an ATM again, which was lucky because the ATM charged me 350 ден to make the withdrawal on my foreign card. I'm uncertain whether all ATMs charge such a high fee, or whether this was for the privilege of withdrawing money in the airport. I read that Halk Bank, Stopanska Banka and Uni Banka all have low fees, but I never needed to test this.

As long as you have a debit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees, then you'll be able to pay for almost everything by card, and won't need to go to an ATM more than once during your stay.

## Getting vegan food in Skopje

When it comes to getting vegan food, I found Skopje to be a little bit lacking in quality options.

By far the best place to get vegan food is Paradise Food (below). I went there pretty much every other day that I was in Skopje, but beyond that I found it better to cook at home.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SCGNg7VbJvUYaLfFA'>Vegan 365</ExternalLink> _should_ have been my kind of place, being a family-run vegan restaurant with a focus on preventing animal cruelty, yet I found it to continually be so frustrating that I never left happy.

It would be closed on sporadic and seemingly random days. I came here on two occasions when it should have been open, only to find that it wasn't. It's a small restaurant with only four tables, and on one of the four occasions that I did eat here I was sat at alone the smallest table, which can comfortably sit no more than two people. Although other tables were free when I arrived, service was so slow that day (a continual issue) that by the time my food arrived there were no free tables left. Right as I was about to tuck-into my rather messy burger, these two large German women stood over me to ask _"do you mind if we sit here too?"_

There was a much bigger table at the back of the restaurant also occupied by only one person, not to mention free tables outside, so in my head I was thinking _"no, fuck off and let me eat my burger in peace."_ Yet for some reason I have a desire to avoid any kind of conflict, so sheepishly agreed, and had to eat trapped in a corner by these large Germans. I didn't like that they asked in the first place (I did note that a high percentage of the customers here were a bit odd), but I didn't like even more that the staff, who were standing right there, didn't ask them to wait for a free table or to sit outside.

Just because it's a fully-vegan restaurant I came back again, and to avoid the previous issues I picked a quiet time and was the only customer, yet right as my food arrived a woman walked-in with a buggy and a screaming baby. It was plain from the reactions of the staff that this baby was part of the family of this family run restaurant. But they then proceded to change this baby, on one of the restaurant tables. The one right behind me. So I had the both the smell and the incessant crying of a baby being changed one to two metres away from where I was trying to have lunch. I will never, ever return to this restaurant.

Although not vegan, I had a much better experience at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/SGindcP4vDMVAQgu8'>Zen Gusto</ExternalLink>. It's basic food, but they have a couple of vegan options on their menu including a vegan feta sandwich.

And as I speak Thai, I wanted to find someone in Skopje to speak Thai with. That was part of my motivation for going to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/uscdEKaZbXK4Hz7z9'>Thai Box</ExternalLink>, although more interesting was that one of the keywords on Google Maps reviews of Thai Box is 'middle finger', in which you'll find three separate reviews of people claiming that the staff gave them the middle finger. That made me want to come here even more, but the staff were lovely, and I chatted to the Thai chef in Thai for a while which made me happy.

Unfortunately the food was a little lacking. I came in and asked for something vegan, When I was offered rice with vegetables, I asked if they had any tofu. They didn't. So it was just rice with vegetables, but at least I got to practice Thai for a bit.

The labels on this items are only written in Macedonian, so it's a bit of a guessing game, but the food always seemed alright. Getting ChatGPT to translate my receipt I can tell you that this is a lasagne for 120 ден, a wholegrain pizza for 100 ден, and a kutab (🤷‍♂️) for 90 ден, so this plate only cost me 310 ден and was just as filling as the plates from the buffet.",

### Groceries

When going to supermarkets in Skopje, you can expect to find plenty of vegan cheese, like in every city in eastern Europe for reasons I've never understood. Other than that, intentionally vegan options are a little bit lacking - you won't find too much pre-prepared vegan food that you can pop in the oven or microwave. And for some reason none of the supermarkets here stock tofu, which is weird. The only place I found tofu was in the fridge of Paradise Food, where they make and sell it.

    src: `${imagePath}/vegan-food/groceries/vegan-cheese.jpeg`,
    alt: 'Ramstore supermarket vegan cheese',
    caption: 'Eastern Europe sure does love vegan cheese for some reason. Here it is in Ramstore supermarket, but more imporantly, look at all the hummus!',

    alt: 'Paradise Food tofu',
    caption: "Tofu isn't stocked in any of the supermarkets here, which is a bit odd. I can't remember going to another city where that was the case. Luckily Paradise Food make and see their own, so you can still pick some up if you need it.",
  },

    src: `${imagePath}/vegan-food/groceries/hummus-pasta.jpeg`,
    alt: 'Hummus pasta',
    caption: "One of my go-to meals is hummus pasta, because you just need to boil some pasta and save a bit of the cooking water to mix in a pot of hummus. Here I made it with wholewheat pasta and added some chickpeas and a lot of parsley because I bought a bag of it and only had five weeks to eat it. All ingredients came from Ramstore supermarket.",
