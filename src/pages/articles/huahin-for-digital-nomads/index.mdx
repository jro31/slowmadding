When you think of the prototypical sexpat destinations in Thailand, you immediately think of Pattaya and Patong (in Phuket). Huahin is famous for being the favoured holiday destination of the late king [Rama IX].

My only previous visit here came in [2016]. I came in the (very) low season and I found it to be a nice refuge away from the sleezy elements that many that aforementioned places so popular among balding middle aged white men. Coming back here in 2023 would have the late king turning in his grave. While not of the same extent as the likes of Pattaya; not even close, Huahin has definitely lost the charm that made it a favoured holiday destination for locals, and less so for foreigners. Instead it's now rapidly expanding with aging white men with money to spend riding around on motorcycles, and bars and massage parlous designed to get them to do so. It's a transformation that robs it of the charm that it had on my last visit here.
