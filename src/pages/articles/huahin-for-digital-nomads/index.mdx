When you think of the prototypical sexpat destinations in Thailand, you immediately think of Pattaya and Patong (in Phuket). Huahin is famous for being the favoured holiday destination of the late king Rama IX. When foreigners want to go to the beach, they go to Samui or Phuket, when Thai people want to go to the beach, they go to Huahin. That's the way I've always viewed it.

My only previous visit here came in [2016]. I came in the (very) low season and I found it to be a nice refuge away from the sleezy elements that make the aforementioned places so popular among balding middle aged white men. Seeing what it's turned into in 2023 would have the late king turning in his grave. While not of the same extent as the likes of Pattaya; not even close, Huahin has definitely lost the charm that made it a favoured holiday destination for locals. Instead it's now rapidly growing in popularity with aging white men with money, and bars and massage parlous to get them to part with it. It's a transformation that robs it of the charm that it had on my last visit here.

I arrived in Huahin like a tornado. In less than two hours after getting off the bus I'd already got a visa extension [add link to article]. I then visited nearby supermarkets and gyms to find the best ones to use while I'm here, before walking all over the city well into the early hours of the night. The next morning I went for a run on the beach, had another busy day exploring, and started making big plans for what I wanted to do here, like running up the big mountain thing I can see from my hotel. But how do you make God laugh? You tell him your plans for the future.

I went out for a couple of beers that evening, although I don't think that played a factor. While slightly tipsy, I wasn't stumbling around drunk. Yet walking down the street I somehow turned on my ankle sufficiently that I fell to the ground, and knew immediately it was a nasty sprain. So instead of going to the gym and running up mountains, I was now bed-bound and travelling the three metres to the bathroom was an arduous process.

The injury was sufficient that I couldn't initially make it down to the hotel reception, so getting a takeaway wasn't even an option. I had to ration the little food I'd already bought at the supermarket; a couple of servings of granola and soy milk, to keep me sustained until I could walk again.

Running up a mountain suddenly felt very far away.

I tell you this story not for sympathy, rather because it very much changed the tone of my visit to Huahin where I'd arrived with a ferocity to be active and do so much here. Instead I existed in a whimper as I recovered. Had things transpired differently, this article could have featured some very different things, so look at it more as the sick man's guide to Huahin. I hope to come back sometime and experience this place as it really should be.
