Huahin is a town famous for being the favoured holiday destination of the late king Rama IX and as such, has a reputation of being a beach destination in Thailand favoured by locals, compared to the likes of Koh Samui or Phuket which are favoured by foreigners.

That felt true on my only prior visit here in 2016, and was the reason I returned this time; I wanted to be somewhere peaceful and relaxed. A slightly ironic quirk considering how much I drank this time, although I'll get into that in a second.

What I found on returning, is that Huahin has become a haven for foreign retirees. Put another way, it's full of old white men. Most are resident here, others are visiting short-term. And for better or worse, the presence of mostly single elderly men who, compared to the average Thai person, have a lot of money, changes a place as services aimed at getting such clientele to part with their money pop-up.

Now don't make the mistake of thinking Huahin is on the same level as Pattaya or of Patong in terms of its sex industry, it's not even close. This is still a very sleepy town in comparison. However it's scene has definitely grown since my prior visit, as there are a couple of bar areas now that I don't think even existing last time I was here. There are dozens and dozens of bars in each, and there's no shortage of massage parlours with scantily-clad women shouting “massage hansum man” at you as you walk past.

This is a new eccentricity that I don't recall from my previous visit.

When I arrived in Huahin I was like a tornado. In less than two hours of getting off the bus I'd already <Link href='/articles/getting-a-visa-extension-in-huahin'>got a visa extension</Link>, then before the day's end I'd already visited all the nearby supermarkets to find the best one, visited two gyms that I could potentially go to, and walked all around Huahin into the early hours of the night. I'd only got off the bus in the mid-afternoon.

The next morning I got up and went for a run on the beach, had another busy day exploring, and started making big plans for what I wanted to do here, like running up this big mountain thing I could see from my hotel. I'd asked some people about it and they said it was possible.

How do you make God laugh? You tell him your plans for the future.

That night I went out for a couple of beers. I was marginally tipsy, but I wasn't stumbling around drunk. Yet somehow as I was walking along the street I managed to turn on my ankle to the point that I fell to the ground, and knew immediately that I'd sprained it. I have a long history of sprained ankles unfortunately.

Without even a second thought, I pulled myself up off the floor and started in the opposite direction, back towards my hotel, because with a sprain you remain mobile until you take the weight off your feet, but once you do, your ankle swells up and you can't put any weight on it for a while, so I just knew that I had to get back to the safety of my hotel room as quickly as possible.

The injury was sufficient that the next day I could put literally no weight onto my foot. I couldn't even make it down to the hotel reception to collect a take-away, so it was lucky that I'd bought some soy milk and granola when I'd been scouting the supermarkets a day earlier, because that was all I had to keep me alive.

For whatever reason; perhaps the need to go out get food just to survive, I was able to put some weight on my foot again after just one day being completely incapacitated, but running up a mountain wasn't going to be happening anytime soon.

I tell you this story not for sympathy, or at least not just for sympathy, rather that it very much changed the tone and ferocity of my visit to Huahin. Where as I'd arrived like a tornado, I existed as a whimper while I recovered and my mobility was limited. Had things transpired differently, this article may have adopted a very different tone, so perhaps look at it as the sick man's guide to Huahin. What I learned while I was here, is the fact that I don't drink very often is predicated on my enjoyment of exercise.

You don't quite realise how many things you do require two legs until you don't have one. Want to get a Thai massage? The way they twist up your body I wasn't going anywhere near a massage shop in my physical state. Want to run on the beach or up a mountain? Yep, needs two legs. Want to do yoga? Yep, you need a fully-flexible ankle for that too.

As I realised, my motivation to not get drunk, or rather to not get hungover, is that I like to exercise, and I rarely exercise when I'm hungover. So when I'm sitting in my room deciding whether to go for a beer or not, the devil on my shoulder is telling me to go for it, where as the angel is saying _“no don't, you won't be able to go for a run tomorrow if you do.”_

Turns-out if I can't exercise, I just drink a lot. Glad I know that now.

Huahin is known for its beach. If you come here, that's probably why. However if that's your motivation, I'd say don't bother.

I didn't spend as much time at the beach as I otherwise would have done, because for the first week after this injury my ankle was constantly wrapped in bandages, which are a massive pain to remove and redress, so getting sand in them would make it even worse. Once I'd graduated onto an ankle support that was far easier to remove, I did go to the beach a little bit, but I didn't enjoy it.

You know the best way to ruin a perfectly good beach? Jet-skis.

The beach in Huahin is long and straight. It's not like in a cove, where you're protected from sound. On a straight beach, a jet-ski two miles away still makes an endless, annoying whirring sound like you're on a racetrack.

I'm not really a big fan of beaches to begin with. They're just sandy and hot. There are two reasons that I like going to them.

One is that it can be nice to swim in the sea sometimes, and two is the serenity of the sound of the water. A quiet beach is a perfect place to meditate.

Seeing as on Huahin beach the endless “waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh” of jet-skis drowns-out the sound of the ocean, then forget about coming here to relax. And seeing as the doorknobs that ride these jet-skis feel the need to ride them close to the shore, right where people want to swim, then you can forget about having a relaxing dip as well.

Maybe out of the town there are some quieter bays; I didn't really explore this, but the main tourist beach? An absolute waste of time. Why they don't ban these jet-skis is beyond me. They ruin the biggest selling point of this town so a couple of people can make money.

Away from the beach, Huahin is quite a pleasant place. It's not exciting, there really isn't very much going on, but if you're like me and you enjoy just existing, then it's quite a nice place to exist. You can find some good places to sit, which is good when you can't walk very far without taking a break.
