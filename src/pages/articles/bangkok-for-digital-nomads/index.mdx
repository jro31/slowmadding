export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

I first came here in 2011 as a tourist and stayed in Silom and Wongwian Yai. In the first half of 2012 I was studying here and had an apartment in Phasi Charoen, then by the end of 2012 I was working and living in Ladprao. I came back as tourist at the beginning of 2015 and stayed in Sutthisan, then came back properly by the end of 2015 to work, and lived in Sathorn, and have since come back as a digital nomad staying in Phrom Pong, Khlong Toei, Thong Lor and a different part of Sathorn.

Wearing all these hats and staying in all these areas, I know Bangkok better than anywhere else in the world but I'm going to do my best to keep this article just about being a digital nomad here. I apologise if I stray.

Thailand has some of the fastest Internet in the world, and that all starts with Bangkok. Good luck finding anywhere in the city that you can't get a 5G connection, so you're never going to have trouble connecting to video calls. The Meetup community here is absolutely thriving, so pretty much seven days per week you'll be able to find Meetup events that suit your taste, whether that be restaurants, bars or clubs, coffee shops or parks, or running or fitness groups. Arriving in Bangkok with no friends is no problem, and even without the mass of Meetup groups and Facebook events, it's not a hard city to meet people by just going and sitting in a bar.

Green space is fairly limited, but there are a couple of nice parks in Bangkok which I'll detail in the running section. Although it would be nice if there were fewer cars and more trees, you do have spaces to escape the traffic, and although it still has a way to go, Bangkok's rail network is ever expanding and its bus network, which goes to every corner of the city but has in the past been hard for foreigners to figure-out, is becoming ever more accessible.

Bangkok is a big, bustling, dirty city that has everything you could ever want. Knowing where to find it is another matter.

## Which area to stay in Bangkok

Bangkok centres around Sukhumvit. Other people will dispute that, claiming that Siam or even Silom are the centre of Bangkok, and that's ok. They're allowed to be wrong. When coming to Bangkok for the first time and trying to figure-out where to stay, start with Sukhumvit (around the Terminal 21 shopping mall) and work outwards from there until you find what you're looking for.

If you head north-west just a few hundred metres, you'll get to Nana, which is the horribly touristy area favoured by sexpats and has many bars catering to them. If you're coming here for daytime drinking and prostitutes, you need look no further.

Continue north-west from there another kilometre or so and you'll make it to Siam. If you love shopping, and particularly shopping malls, then this is your dream. Siam Paragon and Central World are two of best known hi-so shopping malls in the area, and MBK is great for a faux local experience.

If instead go south-east from Sukhumvit, the further you travel the more you'll be in areas favoured by expats over tourists. Firstly you'll be in Phrom Pong. I recommend this area, particularly to someone coming to Bangkok for the first time. You're away from the extreme tourism, but you're still in an area that a lot of tourists choose to stay in so everything is very easy and there'll be things that, as a digital nomad, will be useful.

Beyond Phrom Pong you get to Thong Lo, and then to Ekkamai. Both areas are heavily favoured by expats so are great if you want to meet foreigners living rather than visitng Bangkok. Travelling on from there things will get more local and less expensive. On Nut is a place where many expats who want to live a bit more cheaply stay.

Going south-west from Suhumvit you're going to reach the Sathorn/Silom area. Silom was once a bustling area of the city, but coming back since the pandemic it's died a bit. I love Sathorn and lived there for more than three years. You're still near enough to the central parts of the city, but can also find some peace. It's not a cheap area to stay if you're a digital nomad on a budget though.

Heading north from Sukhumit, you'll get to areas of the city that are visited much less by foreigners, but that still feel like the city centre.

Rama 9 has some more shopping malls but there isn't too much more there. I lived in Ladprao for a couple of years, and it feels like its own city, having its own downtown area around Phahon Yothin, and for years I wanted to live in the area between Saphan Kwai and Ari. I always thought it was the perfect area. Bustling with life but only a short walk from Chattuchak Park, away from all the tourists but within easy reach of some fun bars around Victory Monument or up in Ladprao.

Unfortunately it's so void of tourists that I've never been able to find anywhere that I actually want to stay as a digital nomad. If I ever live in Bangkok again though, it'll definitely be on my list.

If you like staying in big cities, then Bangkok has exactly what you're looking for. The trouble is finding it, especially if you've never been here before. I'd recommend avoiding the Khao San Road and Nana areas as they're both unpleasantly touristy. They can be easily visited for a night out, but I wouldn't want to stay in them outside of that. Other than that, many areas of the city have positives. If you've never been here before and you're completely unsure, then around Phrom Pong/Thong Lo is a safe option. Neither are the most exciting, but you'll have everything you need nearby and almost everyone you encounter will speak English.

## Where I stayed

Before looking for somewhere to stay in Thailand, you should be aware that rentals of less than 30 days are illegal in Thailand at any property that is not registered as a hotel.

In Thailand, the way that the law is written and the way that the law is enforced do not strictly align, and many people will rent privately from landlords for less than 30 days without issue. However, there are a couple of reasons why I avoid doing this, and why the places that I stayed at are all registered as hotels.

The first is that although in 95% of cases you can rent an Airbnb or equivalent for less than 30 days without issue, in the other 5% (I made up those numbers) you will run into problems. That might just be an over-enthusiastic security guard who takes a little financial encouragment to look the other way, or you may find the building management kicking you out. You won't face any legal repercussions; it is the landlord who is renting to you illegally, but you may well be kicked-out of the building that you're staying at and find yourself homeless.

When I was living in Bangkok, the building I lived at strictly enforced this law. There were signs everywhere telling short-term renters that they were not welcome and that they were there illegally, and every year when I renewed my contract with the landlord, getting the juristic office to reactivate my keycard for another year was a massive hassle of them reading over my contract and checking my passport.

I didn't mind it because as a long-term resident I didn't want the property to be used as a hotel, but it also highlighted to me the risks of using Airbnb in Thailand.

The Internet is littered with examples of people who rented-out a short-term Airbnb, only to find themselves homeless when the building management wouldn't let them stay. <ExternalLink url='https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/zy06ln/did_anyone_go_through_this_guard_didnt_allow_us/'>This is one example</ExternalLink>. There are many more.

The other reason to avoid these illegal rentals is that if you plan on doing a visa extension in Bangkok, you are often required to have a TM30. That is a form completed by the owner/manager of the property in which you are staying, reporting that you are staying there. Essentially, the Thai authorities want to track where you sleep on every night that you're in the country, and the TM30 form is how they do that.

If you are staying in a property illegally, the landlord will not be able to complete this TM30 form which will subsequently preclude you from getting a visa extension. A simple work around is to check-into a hostel for one night on the day you go to immigration to get the visa extension, and have them complete the TM30, but it's an added hassle/expense that you will face when renting illegally.

How strictly you choose to abide by this law is up to you, but it's worth being aware that short-term rentals in Thailand are illegal. Below therefore, are the hotels that I stayed at in Bangkok, in the absence of a willingness to use Airbnb.

### Nandha Hotel

<AccommodationTable details={nandhaHotelDetails} />

Nandha will forever hold the title of being the first place that I stayed as a digital nomad. I'm sure that means a lot to them. As a place to start, it really isn't bad. The room was big, with ample space to do yoga and other exercise. Out of shot of the below photo is a table with a couple of chairs that was a great place to setup my laptop on days that I was working.

It's on Sukhumvit soi 33, which is a really easy location. It's no more than 10 minutes walking to get to Phrom Pong BTS station, and not too much further in the other direction to get to Sukhumvit MRT, so you're really in the centre of things. There are shopping malls including supermarkets nearby, and it walking distance to both Benchasiri Park and Benchakitti Park; both good places to run.

It's a bike-themed hotel, which I don't understand. That means that instead of having a doorbell on the door, it has a bike bell. The bike bell on your door is entirely indistinguishable from the bike bell on every door on that floor, so it's impossible to know if someone is trying to get into your room or not. That's annoying. Other than that the bike theme was peculiar, but insignificant.

There's a cafe on the ground floor but it doesn't offer anything vegan, so I didn't eat there during my stay. And it's worth noting that if you want your room cleaned, on the back of the 'Do not disturb' sign is a 'Please clean my room' sign. I didn't realise this, so it was only after I'd been here for a week and no one had even been in to change the bin that I went to reception to ask why. Turns out if you don't put this sign out, they just ignore you.

Other than that I can't fault this place. The wifi was fast, it was very comfortable and I thought the cost was really fair. I'd happily stay here again.

### V Check Inn Sukhumvit 22

<AccommodationTable details={vCheckInnDetails} />

I got attracted to this place by the large balcony, which is only available for the 5th floor rooms. If you can get one of those then this is a really good value hotel.

It's located at the non-Sukhumvit end of Sukhumvit soi 22. That's a pretty long soi, of which the other end is a massive tourist trap of bars and massage parlours. Once you get down to this end though you're away from all that. There's a collection of street vendors and a 7-11 behind the hotel, and you can walk to the Queen Sirikit end of Benchakitti Park in about 15 minutes. If you want to avoid the touristy end of soi 22, there are a couple of roads you can cut-down to get onto soi 24 instead, which comes out right next to Phrom Pong BTS. Asok BTS, and Sukhumvit and Queen Sirikit MRT stations are also easily walkable.

The room itself is decent. The bed is comfortable and the balcony is a great place if you needed some time to sit and think (smoke weed), or if you just want to eat some food.

A couple of small grievances that I had were that they don't clean the room automatically, you have to specifically ask someone on the front desk. That's fine, except there's not always someone there, so if your bin's full you end up waiting 10 minutes for them to come back from the bathroom, just to ask someone to make up the room.

The other frustration was that there is a very loud water pump. I'm used to sleeping in loud places, but it was significant enough that it bugged me when I first arrived. It goes on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds, on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds, all day and all night long. Like anything consistent, by my second day here it had become background noise and it never stopped me from sleeping again, but if you do get easily disturbed, it's something to consider.

I'd definitely be willing to stay here again in a pinch. It was perfectly comfortable, I liked the location and the local amenities, and I enjoyed chatting with the owners.

### RoomQuest Sukhumvit 36

<AccommodationTable details={roomQuestFirstStayDetails} />

<AccommodationTable details={roomQuestSecondStayDetails} />

<AccommodationTable details={roomQuestThirdStayDetails} />

You might think that because I stayed here three times, it's because I really loved this place. The truth is that it's no better than any other hotel on this list, and I'm not sure why I kept coming back. It's cheap, that helps, but was the room nicer than the other hotels listed here? Not really. Did it have more facilities? Nope. Was it at least cleaner? No, it was filthy. Was the location better?

I did like the location because, despite being in Thong Lor, it didn't feel touristy. Unlike at other hotels here, I could walk down the street from RoomQuest without being pestered for a massage, and there's a large 7-11 very nearby. Other than that the location is ok, but not amazing. It's _just_ walking distance from Benchakitti Park (about a 40 minute walk) which is a good place to go running, but every other hotel on this list has somewhere closer. There are a couple of good vegan restaurants within easy walking distance, but again, that's nothing special for this list. In truth, I don't know why I kept on coming back.

The staff were all lovely (apart from the moody woman who works the night-shift), but there was an incredibly high turnover. They only have three receptionists employed at any one time, and I saw at least six of them during my stays. Not surprising really, because they all have to work twelve-hour shifts day-after-day. I'd quit pretty quickly too if someone tried to make me work twelve hours. It has a pool, but on my first stay here I was recommended not to swim in it because it's turned green. It's not a pool you can really sit next to either, so in my six weeks here, I didn't see a single person in it. It just sits there behind reception anonymously. I guess the reason I kept coming back, is it does the essential things well.

It has really, really fast wifi; I clocked a 555mb/s download speed when I did a speed test here, and in the superior rooms, the TV is huge. At a guess I'd say 55". I used to own a 55" TV and these looked the same. It may sound superficial, but that's all I really need.

If I have a comfortable bed, good air-conditioning, fast wifi and a big TV, that's pretty much all I look for. I don't care that the room's dirty. I don't care that it has no worthwhile facilities. It does the essential things well. And when it does the essential things well and it's cheap then... well why pay more?

### Parvena Hotel Sathorn

<AccommodationTable details={parvenaHotelSathornDetails} />

I used to live only about a 20-minute walk from here. Despite being so close, I wouldn't come to this very often. My work was in a different direction, the city centre was in a different direction, the supermarkets I went to were in a different direction. I just had very little reason to come here, but every time I did I always thought to myself _"Wow! What a fun, vibrant area."_ Then I wouldn't come back for another six months. Now with the freedom of a digital nomad, I decided that I'd stay here and get to know this area properly, and it really is a great area.

Although there are a few expats mulling around, as there are everywhere in Bangkok, it's a pretty local area. There's loads going on with street food and vendors lining all along the road outside the hotel, which gives it a very bustling, fun vibe. It also means that you can get everything you need just metres from the hotel entrance. There's a 7-11 twenty metres away, and if you're willing to walk for five minutes you'll pass five of them. There's also a fully vegan restaurant (Bai Plu House) just a couple of minutes away, a nice coffee shop with vegan options (Bartels) that opened in January 2023, which is a lovely place to sit with a book, several laundrettes within easy walk, quite a few weed shops, and if you're willing to venture a bit further, you can get to Silom and all it offers. And for those who're really lazy, the hotel offers a free tuk-tuk to anywhere within 3 miles (which includes Silom or Lumphini MRT station). I only used this service once, preferring to walk because as I said, it's a nice area to just be in.

As for the hotel itself, I liked it. I was up on the top (8th) floor, so had good views and was well away from the traffic below, not that noise really bothers me much nowadays. The room is spacious enough, even if not huge. I could comfortably do yoga, the bed was comfy, it included a large fridge and had a kettle (although you have to provide your own tea/coffee and cups). The TV was a decent size and quality, the AC worked really well, it has a balcony that's big enough to sit on, and the shower is hot and powerful.

For all the above I loved this place, however there are a couple of deal-breakers that would stop me from staying again.

Firstly, for some inexplicable reason the Internet connection requires you to go through a sign-in page. You know the kind? Back when the Internet was a new thing and hotels would charge guests by the hour you'd have to sign-in to track your usage. Well despite having unlimited Internet here, they've not done away with the sign-in page, which is an absolute pain, because anytime you put your device to sleep you'll find yourself having to sign-in again. Every time I turn on my laptop, I have to go through the sign-in page. Everytime I look at my phone after a few minutes away, I have to go through the sign-in page. Worse was every time I turned on my Apple TV, because there I had to sign-in through my phone, so just watching a few minutes of Netflix became an arduous process.

Worse still was that although this wifi had a respectable download speed (typically around 68mbps in the speed tests I did), the upload speed was atrocious. The fastest of the many speed tests I did was 4.53mbps. What that basically means is you can watch Netflix without a problem, and you can work on your laptop, but the second you need to make a video call you'll continually be dropping-out. It was so bad that I just tethered my laptop to my mobile hotspot to make video calls and used my 5G (AIS has great reception in the hotel). Signing-in continually got so annoying to me that I just stopped doing it on my phone and used my mobile data instead.

The second reason that I wouldn't return here is that although it has a desk and chair to work at, it is the most uncomfortable desk and chair I think I've ever sat at, and I have pretty low standards. As a digital nomad on a modest budget, I have to be ok with working from almost anywhere. Even if I have a good desk, I spend 50% of my time working either in bed, or on a sofa if one is available. The other 50% I like to sit at a desk though, to give my body alignment some variety. Here I used the desk for nothing but video calls, and spent 100% of my time working from my bed because it was so uncomfortable. I'm not sure why. It definitely didn't help that the chair was flat and made from wood, although that's not too uncommon. The height of the desk just didn't work with the chair though, and despite having a laptop stand to raise the height of my machine, I found myself getting a sore back within minutes.

It's honestly a shame that two such easily fixable things ruin this place. Thailand has some of the fastest Internet in the world and in Bangkok especially, getting a good connection is not very hard. And furniture much better than this is so cheap here. As a digital nomad what two things do you need? A moderately comfortable place to work, and a good Internet connection. This hotel offers neither, so despite having so much good going for it, in particular the area that it's in, I wouldn't stay here again. At least not as a digital nomad.

## Where to get vegan food in Bangkok

According to <ExternalLink url='https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/travel/top-vegan-friendly-cities'>a 2022 Happy Cow article</ExternalLink>, Bangkok is the 7th most vegan-friendly city in the world. I first lived in Bangkok as a vegan back in 2012, and back then it really wasn't so great.

The consequence of that is I got to watch this city grow into the vegan superpower it is today, and have a knowledge of Bangkok as a vegan city about as extensive as anyone's. I could write a book on it.

I want to keep this article somewhat concise, but at the same time I don't want to waste that knowledge, so this is my quick list of the best of vegan Bangkok.

## The best vegan restaurants in Bangkok

### Bonita Cafe and Social Club

Bonita is what I think of as the OG vegan restaurant in Bangkok. It only opened in 2012, so I'm sure it wasn't the first, but it was the first that I went to, and back then there really wasn't much else vegan-friendly in this city.

It has since moved to a new location not far from the first, but apart from that it remains the same restaurant it was back in 2012, with to the best of my memory, the same menu, which consists of things like a full-English breakfast, burgers, sandwiches and desserts.

Because of this nostalgia I perhaps view Bonita with rose-tinted spectacles, but even now I recommend it as one of the best vegan restaurants in Bangkok and should definitely be on your list of places to eat when in Bangkok.

### May Veggie Home

Another vegan restaurant that I fondly remember as being here before it was cool is May.

I first discovered May in its Asok location, a two-minute walk from Asok BTS/Sukhumvit MRT stations, where it's easy to get to from anywhere in the city, so was a great meeting place. I've never found out why they moved because I was out of the country at the time, but they've since relocated to a spot about a 10-minute walk from Punnawithi BTS station, which is far too out of the way to be a regular visitor unless you're staying nearby.

Perhaps because of this, they've also since opened a smaller 'May Veggie Home Express' branch about a 10-minute walk from Asok BTS, that is not nearly as nice to visit.

That being said, I'd still recommend making the trip to their main restaurant during your time in Bangkok. It's one of the better value places in Bangkok to get vegan Western food (you can get a vegan burger with fries for 170 baht), and I've never had a bad meal here in any location.

### Veganerie

My first visit to Veganerie was in January 2015, when it was a solitary vegan cake shop on the 4th floor of the not very desirable Mercury Ville shopping mall, but it opened my eyes to how truly good vegan desserts can be. Since that point they've expanded to what I can only describe as a vegan empire in Bangkok.

The first branch that expanded beyond desserts was Veganerie Concept behind Benchasiri Park. I went here for the first time in 2017, and it's still my favourite branch, but they've since expanded to have branches of various types in Silom, Nana, Siam Paragon, Em Quartier and other location that I haven't been to. The Mercury Ville location is mercifully no longer there.

The menu varies by location (although the Benchasiri Park, Nana and Silom all have the same menu), but it's a perfect mix of healthy dishes like smoothie bowls and salads, western food like burgers and wraps, smoothies, milkshakes, and of course some amazing desserts. And given how they're expanding with the design of world domination, they're likely to have a branch nearby to where you're staying.
