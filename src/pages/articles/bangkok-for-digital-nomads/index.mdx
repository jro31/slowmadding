## Where I stayed

Before looking for somewhere to stay in Thailand, you should be aware that rentals of less than 30 days are illegal in Thailand at any property that is not registered as a hotel.

In Thailand, the way that the law is written and the way that the law is enforced do not strictly align, and many people will rent privately from landlords for less than 30 days without issue. However, there are a couple of reasons why I avoid doing this, and why the places that I stayed at below are registered as hotels.

The first is that although in 95% of cases you can rent an Airbnb or equivalent for less than 30 days without issue, in the other 5% (I made up those numbers) you will run into problems. That might just be an over-enthusiastic security guard who takes a little financial encouragment to look the other way, or you may find the building management kicking you out.

You won't face any legal repercussions; it is the landlord who is renting to you illegally, but you may well be kicked-out of the building that you're staying at and find yourself homeless.

When I was living in Bangkok, the building I lived at strictly enforced this law. There were signs everywhere telling short-term renters that they were not welcome and that they were there illegally, and every year when I renewed my contract with the landlord, getting the juristic office to reactivate my keycard for another year was a massive hassle of them reading over the contract and checking my passport.

I didn't mind it, because as a long-term resident, I didn't want the property to be used as a hotel, but it also highlighted to me the risks of using Airbnb in Thailand.

The Internet is littered with examples of people who rented-out a short-term Airbnb, only to find themselves homeless when the building management wouldn't let them stay. <ExternalLink url='https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/zy06ln/did_anyone_go_through_this_guard_didnt_allow_us/'>This is one example</ExternalLink>. There are many more.

The other reason to avoid these illegal rentals, is that if you plan on doing a visa extension in Thailand, you are required to have a TM30. That is a form, completed by the owner/manager of the property in which you are staying, reporting that you are staying there. Essentially, the Thai authorities want to know where you stay on every night that you're in the country, and this is how they do that.

If you are staying in a property illegally, then the landlord will not be able to complete this TM30 form, which will subsequently preclude you from getting a visa extension.

A simple work around is to check-into a hostel for one night on the day you go to immigration to get the visa extension, and have them complete the TM30, but it's an added hassle/expense that you will face when renting illegally.

How strictly you choose to abide by this law is up to you, but within reason I try to operate within the law of the country that I'm in. Below therefore, are the hotels that I stayed at in Bangkok, in the absence of a willingness to use Airbnb.

### Nandha Hotel

<AccommodationTable details={nandhaHotelDetails} />

Nandha will forever hold the [moniker] of being the first place that I stayed "as a digital nomad." I'm sure that's very important to them. As a place to start, it really wasn't bad.

The room was really spacious, with ample room to do yoga and other exercise. Out of shot of the below photo is a table with a couple of chairs that was a great place to setup my laptop on days that I was working.

It's on Sukhumvit soi 33, which has a few seedy massage parlours on it. Apart from that, the location is damn near perfect. It's no more than 10 minutes walking to get to Phrom Pong BTS station, and not too much further in the other direction to get to Sukhumvit MRT. That is what I consider to be the centre of Bangkok (others disagree), so you really are in the centre of things here. It's also very close to Benchasiri Park, which is a small but viable place to run, but also walking distance from Benchakitti Park, which is much bigger.

It's a bike-themed hotel, which I don't really get, and it means that instead of having a doorbell on the door, or of staff knocking on the door, it has a bike bell. The bike bell on your door is entirely indistinguishable from the bike bell on every other room on the floor, so it's impossible to know if someone is trying to get into your room or someone elses. Other than that, the bike theme was peculiar, but insignificant.

There's a cafe on the ground floor, but it doesn't offer anything vegan, so I didn't eat there during my stay. And it's worth noting that if you want your room cleaned, on the back of the 'do not disturb' sign is a 'please clean my room' sign. I didn't realise this, so it was only after I'd been here for a week and no one had even been in to change the bin that I went to reception to ask why. Turns out if you don't put out this sign, it basically means do not disturb.

Other than that misunderstanding, I can't really fault this place. The wifi was fast, it was very comfortable and I thought the cost was reasonable. I'd happily stay here again, although anytime I've subsequently looked, I haven't been able to find such a good price, so they might sadly have realised it was a good deal.

### V Check Inn Sukhumvit 22

<AccommodationTable details={vCheckInnDetails} />

I got attracted to this place by the large balcony, which is only available for the 5th floor rooms. If you can get one of those, then this is a really good value hotel.

It's located at the non-Sukhumvit end of Sukhumvit soi 22. That's a pretty long soi, of which the other end is a massive tourist trap of bars and massage parlours. Once you get down to this end though, it feels fairly local. There's a collection of street vendors and a 7-11 behind the hotel, and you can walk to the Queen Sirikit end of Benchakitti Park in about 15 minutes. If you want to avoid the touristy end of soi 22, then there are a couple of rouds you can cut-down to get onto soi 24 instead, which comes out right next to Phrom Pong BTS. Asok BTS, and Sukhumvit and Queen Sirikit MRT stations are also easily walkable.

The room itself is decent. The bed is comfortable, and the balcony was a great place if you needed some time to sit and think, or if you just wanted to eat some food.

A couple of small grievances that I had, were that like Nandha Hotel above, they don't clean the room automatically, as I'm used to happening in hotels. I'm not sure if this was a development during Covid, when people got scared of being around others, but if you wanted the room cleaned, you had to ask someone on the front desk. That's find, except there wasn't always someone there. There would only ever be one person working at a time, usually one of the owners, who were all really nice people. They might have gone to the bathroom or have been called away for something else, so they wouldn't always be on the front desk, in case your room isn't getting made up that day.

The other frustration was that there was a very loud water pump. I'm used to sleeping in loud places, but it was significant enough that it kept me awake for part of my first night. It goes on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds, on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds all day and all night long. Like anything consistent, by my second day here it had become background noise, and it never stopped me from sleeping again, but if you do get easily disturbed, it's something to consider. After that first night, I thought about asking to change rooms, but I realised it was just as loud all over the top floor. I'm not sure if it was like that on other floors, but then you wouldn't get the balcony.

I'd definitely be willing to stay here again in a pinch. It was perfectly comfortable, I liked the location and the local amenities, and I enjoyed chatting with the owners. I'd probably look at other hotels on this list first if I'm honest though.
