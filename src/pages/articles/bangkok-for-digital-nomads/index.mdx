## Where I stayed

Before looking for somewhere to stay in Thailand, you should be aware that rentals of less than 30 days are illegal in Thailand at any property that is not registered as a hotel.

In Thailand, the way that the law is written and the way that the law is enforced do not strictly align, and many people will rent privately from landlords for less than 30 days without issue. However, there are a couple of reasons why I avoid doing this, and why the places that I stayed at below are registered as hotels.

The first is that although in 95% of cases you can rent an Airbnb or equivalent for less than 30 days without issue, in the other 5% (I made up those numbers) you will run into problems. That might just be an over-enthusiastic security guard who takes a little financial encouragment to look the other way, or you may find the building management kicking you out.

You won't face any legal repercussions; it is the landlord who is renting to you illegally, but you may well be kicked-out of the building that you're staying at and find yourself homeless.

When I was living in Bangkok, the building I lived at strictly enforced this law. There were signs everywhere telling short-term renters that they were not welcome and that they were there illegally, and every year when I renewed my contract with the landlord, getting the juristic office to reactivate my keycard for another year was a massive hassle of them reading over the contract and checking my passport.

I didn't mind it, because as a long-term resident, I didn't want the property to be used as a hotel, but it also highlighted to me the risks of using Airbnb in Thailand.

The Internet is littered with examples of people who rented-out a short-term Airbnb, only to find themselves homeless when the building management wouldn't let them stay. <ExternalLink url='https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/zy06ln/did_anyone_go_through_this_guard_didnt_allow_us/'>This is one example</ExternalLink>. There are many more.

The other reason to avoid these illegal rentals, is that if you plan on doing a visa extension in Thailand, you are required to have a TM30. That is a form, completed by the owner/manager of the property in which you are staying, reporting that you are staying there. Essentially, the Thai authorities want to know where you stay on every night that you're in the country, and this is how they do that.

If you are staying in a property illegally, then the landlord will not be able to complete this TM30 form, which will subsequently preclude you from getting a visa extension.

A simple work around is to check-into a hostel for one night on the day you go to immigration to get the visa extension, and have them complete the TM30, but it's an added hassle/expense that you will face when renting illegally.

How strictly you choose to abide by this law is up to you, but within reason I try to operate within the law of the country that I'm in. Below therefore, are the hotels that I stayed at in Bangkok, in the absence of a willingness to use Airbnb.

### Nandha Hotel

<AccommodationTable details={nandhaHotelDetails} />

Nandha will forever hold the [moniker] of being the first place that I stayed "as a digital nomad." I'm sure that's very important to them. As a place to start, it really wasn't bad.

The room was really spacious, with ample room to do yoga and other exercise. Out of shot of the below photo is a table with a couple of chairs that was a great place to setup my laptop on days that I was working.

It's on Sukhumvit soi 33, which has a few seedy massage parlours on it. Apart from that, the location is damn near perfect. It's no more than 10 minutes walking to get to Phrom Pong BTS station, and not too much further in the other direction to get to Sukhumvit MRT. That is what I consider to be the centre of Bangkok (others disagree), so you really are in the centre of things here. It's also very close to Benchasiri Park, which is a small but viable place to run, but also walking distance from Benchakitti Park, which is much bigger.

It's a bike-themed hotel, which I don't really get, and it means that instead of having a doorbell on the door, or of staff knocking on the door, it has a bike bell. The bike bell on your door is entirely indistinguishable from the bike bell on every other room on the floor, so it's impossible to know if someone is trying to get into your room or someone elses. Other than that, the bike theme was peculiar, but insignificant.

There's a cafe on the ground floor, but it doesn't offer anything vegan, so I didn't eat there during my stay. And it's worth noting that if you want your room cleaned, on the back of the 'do not disturb' sign is a 'please clean my room' sign. I didn't realise this, so it was only after I'd been here for a week and no one had even been in to change the bin that I went to reception to ask why. Turns out if you don't put out this sign, it basically means do not disturb.

Other than that misunderstanding, I can't really fault this place. The wifi was fast, it was very comfortable and I thought the cost was reasonable. I'd happily stay here again, although anytime I've subsequently looked, I haven't been able to find such a good price, so they might sadly have realised it was a good deal.

### V Check Inn Sukhumvit 22

<AccommodationTable details={vCheckInnDetails} />

I got attracted to this place by the large balcony, which is only available for the 5th floor rooms. If you can get one of those, then this is a really good value hotel.

It's located at the non-Sukhumvit end of Sukhumvit soi 22. That's a pretty long soi, of which the other end is a massive tourist trap of bars and massage parlours. Once you get down to this end though, it feels fairly local. There's a collection of street vendors and a 7-11 behind the hotel, and you can walk to the Queen Sirikit end of Benchakitti Park in about 15 minutes. If you want to avoid the touristy end of soi 22, then there are a couple of rouds you can cut-down to get onto soi 24 instead, which comes out right next to Phrom Pong BTS. Asok BTS, and Sukhumvit and Queen Sirikit MRT stations are also easily walkable.

The room itself is decent. The bed is comfortable, and the balcony was a great place if you needed some time to sit and think, or if you just wanted to eat some food.

A couple of small grievances that I had, were that like Nandha Hotel above, they don't clean the room automatically, as I'm used to happening in hotels. I'm not sure if this was a development during Covid, when people got scared of being around others, but if you wanted the room cleaned, you had to ask someone on the front desk. That's find, except there wasn't always someone there. There would only ever be one person working at a time, usually one of the owners, who were all really nice people. They might have gone to the bathroom or have been called away for something else, so they wouldn't always be on the front desk, in case your room isn't getting made up that day.

The other frustration was that there was a very loud water pump. I'm used to sleeping in loud places, but it was significant enough that it kept me awake for part of my first night. It goes on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds, on for a few seconds, off for a few seconds all day and all night long. Like anything consistent, by my second day here it had become background noise, and it never stopped me from sleeping again, but if you do get easily disturbed, it's something to consider. After that first night, I thought about asking to change rooms, but I realised it was just as loud all over the top floor. I'm not sure if it was like that on other floors, but then you wouldn't get the balcony.

I'd definitely be willing to stay here again in a pinch. It was perfectly comfortable, I liked the location and the local amenities, and I enjoyed chatting with the owners. I'd probably look at other hotels on this list first if I'm honest though.

### Parvena Hotel Sathorn

<AccommodationTable details={parvenaHotelSathornDetails} />

I used to live only about a 20-minute walk from here. Despite being so close, I wouldn't come here very often. My work was in a different direction, the city centre was in a different direction, the supermarkets I went to were in a different direction. I just had very little reason to come here, but every time I did I always thought to myself _"Wow! What a fun, vibrant area."_ Then I wouldn't come back for another six months. Now with the freedom of a digital nomad, I decided that I'd stay here and get to know this area properly, and it really is a great area.

Although there are a few expats mulling around, as there are almost anywhere in Thailand, it's a pretty local area. There's loads going on with street food and vendors lining all along the street, which gives it a very bustling, fun vibe. It also means that you can get everything you need just metres from the hotel entrance. There's a 7-11 twenty metres away, and if you're willing to walk for five minutes you'll get to five of them. There's also a fully vegan restaurant (Bai Plu House) just a couple of minutes away, a nice coffee shop with vegan options (Bartels) that opened in January 2023, which is a lovely place to sit with a book, several laundrettes within easy walk, quite a few weed shops, and if you're willing to venture a bit further, you can get to Silom and all it offers. And for those who're really lazy, the hotel offers a free tuk-tuk to anywhere within 3 miles (which includes Silom or Lumphini MRT station). I only used this service once, preferring to walk because as I said, it's a nice area to just be in.

As for the hotel itself, I liked it. I was up on the top (8th) floor, so had good views and was well away from the traffic below, not that noise really bothers me much nowadays. The room is spacious enough, even if not huge. I could comfortably do yoga at least, and the bed was comfy, it included a large fridge, and had a kettle (although you have to provide your own tea/coffee and cups). The TV was a decent size and quality, the AC worked really well, it has a balcony that's big enough to sit on, and the shower is hot and powerful.

For all the above I loved this place, however there are a couple of deal-breakers that would stop me from staying again.

Firstly, for some inexplicable reason the Internet connection requires you to go through a sign-in page. You know the kind? Back when the Internet was a new thing and hotels would charge guests by the hour you'd have to sign-in to track your usage. Well despite having unlimited Internet here, they've not done away with the sign-in page, which is an absolute pain, because anytime you put your device to sleep you'll find yourself having to sign-in again. Every time I turn on my laptop, have to go through the sign-in page. Everytime I look at my phone after a few minutes away, have to go through the sign-in page. Worse was every time I turned on my Apple TV, because there I had to sign-in through my phone, so just watching a few minutes of Netflix became an arduous process.

Worse still was that although this wifi had a respectable download speed (typically around 68mbps in the speed tests I did), the upload speed was atrocious. The fastest of the many speed tests I did was 4.53mbps. What that basically means is you can watch Netflix without a problem, and you can work on your laptop, but the second you need to make a video call you'll continually be dropping-out. It was so bad that I just tethered my laptop to my mobile hotspot to make video calls and used my 5G (AIS has great reception in the hotel). Signing-in continually got so annoying to me that I just stopped doing it on my phone and used my mobile data instead.

When the Internet it unlimited anyway, I can't for the life of me think of why they haven't got rid of this sign-in system, just giving guests the password for the router like everyone else does.

The second reason that I wouldn't return here is that although it has a desk and chair to work at, it is the most uncomfortable desk and chair I think I've ever sat at, and I have pretty low standards. As a digital nomad on a modest budget, I have to be ok with working from almost anywhere. Even if I have a good desk, I spend 50% of my time working either in bed, or on a sofa if a comfortable one is available. The other 50% I like to sit at a desk though, to give my body alignment some variety. Here I used the desk for nothing but video calls, and spent 100% of my time working from my bed because it was so uncomfortable. I'm not sure why. It definitely didn't help that the chair was flat and made from wood, although that's not too uncommon. The height of the desk just didn't work with the chair though, and despite having a laptop stand to raise the height of my machine, I found myself getting a sore back within minutes.

It's honestly a shame that two such easily fixable things ruin this place. Thailand has some of the fastest Internet in the world and in Bangkok especially, getting a good connection is not very hard. And furniture much better than this is so cheap here. From a digital nomad perspective, what two things do you need? A (preferably comfortable) place to work, and a good Internet connection. This hotel offers neither, so despite having so much good going for it, in particular the area that it's in, I wouldn't stay here again, at least not as a digital nomad.
