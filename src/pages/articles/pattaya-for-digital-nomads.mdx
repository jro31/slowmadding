If you've spent any time in Thailand, and perhaps even if you haven't, you'll be aware of Pattaya's rather sordid reputation. And it's fully justified. The breadth of bars here is mind-blowing and numbers somewhere in the thousands, with some being open 24 hours per day. The number of massage shops isn't too far behind.

While the foreigners who choose to call Pattaya home are generally elderly men who prefer to fraternise with women who would be far too young and attractive to be attainable almost anywhere else in the world, temporary visitors to Pattaya come from far and wide and from all walks of life. It's a city so overrun with tourism that little here has any semblance of Thailand. If you've come to experience local culture, then forget all about coming to Pattaya.

That travellers so inexperienced flock to Pattaya goes some way to explain the Pattaya Flying Club, whose innumerable members come to Pattaya and commit suicide by jumping off their hotel balconies. Some recruits always seem a little suspect to me, such as one who joined during my second visit by jumping from a third floor balcony. If I was intent on suicide and had a third floor room, I think at the very least I'd make the effort to walk up the rooftop to ensure I was successful. Regardless, do come here with your eyes wide open. Many of these suicides are legitimate, with naive men of all ages thinking they've found the perfect girl who's fallen in love with them.

Newsflash: You haven't.

The women here will say and do what they have to so that as much money as possible in your bank account, ends up in their bank account, and when the money is gone, so are they. With no money left and no girl either, it's time to join the Pattaya Flying Club.

This seems very obvious to me and I think would be to anyone who's travelled a bit. As sad as this sounds, I treat any girl who approaches me in South-East Asia as only talking to me for money. There are some guys who just don't understand the game being played, fall in love, and then fall off a balcony. It's the dark-side of Pattaya that the tourist brochures don't tell you about. Don't become one of the statistics.

While Pattaya's reputation is for sex tourism, and you won't be able to avoid that happens here, a lot, if you just want to go to the beach and drink a bit in the evenings, you can still have a great time. There are some nice beaches and you won't be approached by girls in every bar (just most of them).

If you don't plan on drinking or partying at all, then I'd suggest that Pattaya isn't for you. I don't regret coming here once, because it really is a unique place, but after a change of plans and the need to kill an extra month in Thailand, I came for my second visit on a whim and regretted doing so. There's really not that much to do here other than party, and I drank so much during my second stay that I left out-of-shape and unhealthy, and looking back, really didn't have that much fun.

In terms of Pattaya's geography, there are two main areas to be aware of. The centre of Pattaya stretches roughly from the south end of Pattaya Walking Street, approximately three kilometres until the Terminal 21 shopping mall. From the water's edge to roughly a kilometre inland, these three kilometres are little but bars, clubs and massage shops.

I think technically it's not part of Pattaya, but Jomtien can be easily reached by walking or by baht bus, and is a much more relaxed, less in-your-face alternative, popular with Russians for some reason. It has a good night market and some nice beaches, with a much more sightly waterfront that I went running along a few times. As I found out the hard way (not literally), Jomtien Walking Street is Pattaya's very gay gay area.

Usual rules of physical contact don't apply in Pattaya. Walking alone as a man you will be grabbed everywhere by girls with concerning regularity in the busier areas. In the gay area, men do it, so that was a fun surprise.

Despite years living in Thailand, I'd always avoided Pattaya until I became a digital nomad because of its reputation. I don't regret coming here, for the first time at least, because it is a very unique place that has to be experienced to be understood. If you do come here though, just be aware of what you're coming to. If you're expecting some Land of Smiles bullshit where you're going to come and see traditional Thai culture then pull your head out your arsehole. It's the sex tourism capital of the world, and whether you wish to partake or not, you're not going to be able to escape that fact.

## How to take a baht bus in Pattaya

Baht buses, also known as songthaews, are named as such because back in the day they only cost one baht. They're those pick-up trucks with a bench on either side of the truck's bed for passengers to sit on, a roof, and a platform at the back for extra passengers to stand on.

You find them all over Thailand, but in many places they're only really used by locals because foreigners can't figure-out where they go. In Pattaya they're more common than any other place I've been and are used by everyone. Particularly if you want to travel between Pattaya and Jomtien, you'll find yourself using them a lot. During the daytime you'll be passed by roughly one per minute on this route.

I believe they run twenty-four hours per day. I definitely used them to get back to my room after way too many drinks in the middle of the night on multiple occasions. If you're not used to taking them though they can be a little intimidating, so this is how they work.

From the front it can sometimes be a little hard to differentiate them from regular pick-up trucks. It's also hard to tell if they're full until they're stopped next to you, and the driver will happily load-up with as many passengers as are willing to get on. If you're standing on the road looking like someone who might be about to take a baht bus, the driver will typically slow down anyway (which is a bit annoying if you're actually trying to cross the road). You stick your hand out, palm facing down (not like that), and flap your hand up and down to flag to the driver that you wish to get on.

Once the baht bus has stopped you jump in the back, sitting down if there are seats available or hanging off the back if there aren't. Four people can comfortably stand on the rear platform, but if a baht bus pulls-over and there isn't space, don't feel obligated to get on. You can wave the driver away again.

What will happen occasionally with empty baht buses, is that you'll flag it down, the driver will stop, you'll go to get on, but before you have the driver will speed away again. This happened to me on a couple of occasions, and I was all like... the fuck? What I realised is that some of these baht buses also operate as taxis, and if they have no passengers then they're looking for someone they can charge a higher fare to by taking them to a specific location, and by going to get in without talking to the driver, you indicated that isn't you.

Don't be disheartened, it's almost certainly not because you're so repulsive that they don't want you in their truck. Just wait until the next one comes along and try again.

There are nine different routes plied by the baht buses in Pattaya, but most of these operate in the downtown area where everything is in walking distance anyway. Going to Jomtien is when they're most useful, and on Thappraya Road (the road that connects Pattaya to Jomtien), there is only one route, so hail a baht bus here and you know where you're going.

There are no stops. When you want to get off you ring one of the bells and the driver will pull over to the side of the road. Get out and walk to the passenger-side window.

Every baht bus I took in Pattaya cost 10 baht. There may be some routes that charge more, but typically you just hand 10 baht through the window. If there's someone in the passenger seat, give it to them, if not give it to the driver.

They have small amounts of change, so it's fine to pay a 10 baht fare with a 20 baht note, but I doubt they'd react so kindly if you tried to pay with bigger bills. If you're short on change, break a note by buying something cheap from the nearest 7-11 before getting on.

That's it really. Because of their price and regularity they're a really good way of getting around Pattaya, particularly when going to Jomtien. If you want to take a baht bus on a road there are multiple routes, you could ask the driver before getting on, but I found that for only 10 baht I'd just get on and if at any point it started going somewhere I didn't want to go, I'd get off, pay, and take another baht bus that was going the right way.

## Where I stayed

### G Residence

<MapLink name='378/148 Thappraya Road, Soi 15' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/j2GiFYBs2e2TZ4iF7' />

<AccommodationTable details={gResidenceDetails} />

My attitude to staying in towns that have party areas, is that I never stay in the party areas. If I want to party then nothing's stopping me from going there, but when I don't then I want to be away from them.

It was partly just luck, as I mainly stayed here because Yes Vegan is nearby, but the location of G Residence is perfect. It's right in the middle between central Pattaya and Jomtien. You can walk to Pattaya Walking Street in about 25 minutes, and you can walk to central Jomtien in about 25 minutes. The hundreds of baht buses that ply this route cut these journey times to 5 to 10 minutes, so everything is really, really accessible, but you're away from all the craziness for when you want to avoid it.

It's quiet enough that I could go running right from the entrance to the apartment complex, and <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yxDLnLh7mnDroA76'>Food Mart</ExternalLink> supermarket is about a fifteen minute walk away. It's about a five minute walk from G Residence to the nearest 7-11, and a ten minute walk to Yes Vegan, one of the few vegan restaurants in Pattaya. The street Yes Vegan's on also has a very good fruit stand that I'd often buy my smoothie fruit from.

The apartment itself is pretty great. I stayed in what's listed on booking.com as an 'Apartment with balcony'. At 47m² it's the mid-sized apartment that they offer (a studio is 35m², or a two-bedroom apartment is 80m²) and it felt very spacious.

I wouldn't quite call it a one-bedroom as there's not a proper wall between the living area and the bedroom, just a partition. That's fine for me being here on my own, but if you're coming with someone else and want to have a space to get away from them, this might not be sufficient.

There was plenty of space to do my morning exercise in front of the TV, it has a dining table with a couple of chairs that are good for eating at and to use as a workstation, the sofa is great for lounging around on and the king bed is comfortable and has plenty of space around it. There's a balcony with a couple of chairs on it that, if you look to the left, gives you a view of the pool (the view straight ahead is just the side of another building) and the room is cleaned everyday.

There are two flaws to this place. The first is that the wifi is dog-shit. Once you're connected it's fine, but it has a login page where the second you put your device down, you have to login again. Put your phone down for two minutes to use the toilet? Welcome to the login page.

It got to the point that I just wouldn't bother connecting, and would instead use my data, which thankfully had good reception in the room.

The other flaw is that the kitchen is under-equipped. Crucially it has a kettle, but other than that the cooking equipment leaves a lot to be desired, offering just a frying pan that can be used on the hob.

I didn't make use of any of the facilities outside of the apartment. Most obvious is the pool, where I continually told myself I'd go for a swim one day or at least sit next to it and read my book. I never did, but it looked nice from a distance. There's apparently a fitness centre here somewhere as well, although I never sought it out. I guess I was just content enough in my room I didn't really feel the need to explore too much.

Apart from the Internet it's a great place to stay, and I was pretty bummed that it didn't have availability when I made plans to come back to Pattaya again.

### Olympus City Garden

<MapLink name='Soi Kho Pai 4' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/V1KnQZp71PSg1V5h7' />

<AccommodationTable details={olympusCityGardenDetails} />

In the absence of availability at G Residence, I stayed at Olympus City Garden on my second visit to Pattaya. It's an apartment block, so don't make the mistake of thinking that you're staying at a hotel. You're not.

That can be a good thing or a bad thing, but know that through my stay, no one came in to make up the room, no one changed the bedding or the towels, the one toilet roll I was provided with wasn't replenished, the sink didn't include washing up liquid or even a sponge, there were no spare bin liners and no one came in to change the bins. You're responsible for all this stuff.

The positive is that if you don't like people knowing your business, Olympus City Garden is very private.

There are hundreds of apartments in this complex, and the security, while present, is very much out of the way. You don't have to walk past a reception or a security guard each time you go out and come back like in many places. Here, no one knows if you've come or gone, or if you've brought someone with you or if you're staying alone. No one knows and no one cares.

I like that. Perhaps highlighting my own insecurities, I hate how in hotels the receptionists know exactly how often I go outside, because on some days, especially on days I'm working, I might only be out for an hour, but then get conscious that they think I'm spending too much time in the room. Here you are free, so take the lack of hotel services as a positive or a negative, depending on what you like.

I dealt with someone who works here precisely once during my stay. A guy called Jack met me as I arrived, showed me to the room, and I didn't hear from him or see him again until I checked-out and messaged him to say the room was empty.

As for the room, it's listed as 26m² which makes it almost half the size of the room I had at G Residence, despite being more expensive. The use of space for such a small room is both impressive and depressing, cramming a bedroom with double bed, living room and kitchen including a sofa with coffee table and a table and chairs, and a bathroom, all within those 26m. As impressive as it is to get all that in, it does feel cramped.

I had to move the coffee table next to the front door anytime I wanted to exercise, I had to move one of the chairs just so the other could tuck under the table properly and wasn't in the way, and I stored my suitcase upright just so it wasn't taking up too much of the floor.

The kitchen has the two essentials of a kettle and a (large) fridge, as well as a microwave. Beyond this it's very lacking. Lots of crockery, cutlery, and even a knife and chopping board, but the only pan was a large wok. Oddly enough there was a saucepan lid, there just wasn't the saucepan to go with it.

There are two TVs in the apartment on either side of the sliding bedroom door. Unfortunately they're the only TVs I've encountered since I bought it in 2015, that aren't compatible with my Apple TV. They have HDMI slots which is what I normally use to connect my Apple TV, and the picture worked fine, but the sound didn't. For some reason I couldn't get the sound to work at all, which made these TV sets obsolete to me and I used my phone to workout instead.

The biggest frustration with staying here though, was that the Internet was slooooow. Unlike at G Residence, there was no login page thankfully. Once you were connected you stayed connected, it's just that the connection was not only unstable, it was too slow to do video calls. To make matters worse, my mobile data (AIS) had a very weak connection in the room.

It just about worked and when I had to make video calls I'd tether to my mobile and put it next to the window where it got the best signal. Even then they were some patchy calls. As a digital nomad, it's pretty damn annoying to be staying somewhere that you can't get a good connection in your room.

The other main difference from G Residence, is that Olympus City Garden is pretty centrally located in Pattaya. You're not quite in the midst of all the bars, but you're not too far away from them either. Take that as a positive or a negative depending on what you like.

There are definitely worse places to be, but no doubt in my mind I preferred staying at G Residence.

## Where to get vegan food in Huahin

Given the number of tourists, Pattaya has a pretty meagre vegan scene. Dozens of Indian and Middle Eastern restaurants claim to be vegetarian, but I found these to be pretty vegan-unfriendly, with vegan items not being marked on the menu, and items you'd typically expect to be vegan, like a falafel wrap, coming with mayonnaise inside.

The four most vegan-friendly places I found are the following.

### Yes Vegan

By far my most-visited restaurant during my first stay in Pattaya was Yes Vegan. I went there so much that it got embarrassing walking-in. I got the room I did partly because Yes Vegan was nearby, so I was very glad that it turned-out to be good.

It's a fully-vegan restaurant, if you couldn't tell from the name, and the menu's pretty big, with a mix of western and Asian items. It's on a large premesis down a peculiarly Russian soi, so there's little worry that there won't be any seating. The service was always fast on the many times I ate here, and I thought the quality was consistently high. Prices vary, but no item on the menu costs more than 185 baht, and you'll typically pay closer to 125 baht.

If you're staying nearby, this will be your go-to for vegan food in Pattaya, and if you're not it's worth travelling to, particularly given how little else is in Pattaya.

### Apple Vegan Cafe

Apple didn't exist on my first stay, and was only a month old come my second. Being walking distance from Olympus City Garden was part of the reason I decided to stay there.

It's a fully vegan restaurant run by this very sweet lady. It's open Monday to Saturday, and on my first visit when I asked her what time they closed, she responded that the restaurant closes at 10pm, but I could order take-away 24 hours per day. She was the only chef so I quizzed a bit further, and it turns-out that she sleeps in the restaurant, and any time an order comes in, no matter what time of night, she has to get up and head to the kitchen.

I honestly couldn't think of anything worse, but that really is some dedication to making your business work.

The menu is a little limited, but does have some classics that you wouldn't really expect to find on a vegan menu in Thailand. Fish fingers with chips are a meal I can't have had for thirty years, and vegan tuna sandwiches were one of my go-to meals back when I had a kitchen.

On all of my visits to this restaurant, and even when just walking past, I never saw another customer in here so I hope that business picks-up. It's a really nice little place and the owner is such a good person, I feel she deserves to succeed. I hope if I ever come back to Pattaya it's turned-into a thriving business.

### Five Star J Restaurant

Five Star J is a vegatarian, rather than a vegan restaurant, although the majority of items on the huge menu are vegan and are labelled as such.

The menu is honestly a book, it's massive. Perhaps it's dominated slightly by Asian offerings, but there's still plenty of western stuff on there. Ironically, the only thing I ate here that I didn't really like was the one Asian dish I had, the tempeh panang curry. Everything else was really high quality, including the two pasta dishes I had, which is rare.

Service could be a little sporadic, and on my first time coming here it was 35 minutes between ordering and having any food in front of me despite there being only one other customer. Other visits were fine, so maybe they were just having a bad day. It's still definitely worth a visit while in Pattaya.

### Jomtien Night Market

Jomtien night market is a large market including many food stands and lots of seating to eat at. While there are limited other stands that offer vegan things (I think there's a mango sticky rice stand), I'm including it here primarily because there's a fully vegan Mediterranean food stand.

To eat immediately they have small and large falafel sandwiches (60/100 baht), and a falafel set that cost 120 baht and includes falafel, hummus, salad, fries and a pita bread. They also have take-away salads, and the best value hummus I've seen anywhere in Asia.

60 baht for a large tub of hummus. Typically the only hummus you find here is in the posher supermarkets and it's imported and very overpriced (at least 150 baht for a small tub). If I had the cooking facilities, I no doubt would have bought a tonne of it here to make my world famous hummus pasta.

Sadly I didn't, but I still ate here multiple times. It's a great place to come to get some food inside you before a night out in Jomtien.

## Where to run in Pattaya

My experience of running in Pattaya is that the centre of town is too busy with pedetrians and vehicles to run comfortably, but once you get out of the centre it... could be worse.

On my first stay here, while staying between Pattaya and Jomtien, I'd leave my building and run to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/2A5fuCyVCx3vdPkU7'>Yinyom Beach</ExternalLink>. From there you can either run along the beach, along the pavement, or along the road south-east until you're in Jomtien.

While this route does have a lot of beach-going tourists on it, it's not quite so busy that it's uncomfortable to run along, so long as you go sufficiently slowly.

Once in Jomtien you can continue along the beachfront as far as you want before cutting down any of the sois to get to Jomtien Second Road. While busy with traffic, Jomtien Second Road and Thappraya Road that it turns into, have pavements all the way along and not too many pedestrians so is relatively comfortable to follow back. It goes all the way back to the centre of Pattaya.

Knowing this route, when I came back to Pattaya for a second time I did the same thing, except started running in the centre of Pattaya as soon as the pedestrians and traffic thinned enough that I could.

It's not an especially amazing route, you have to cross some busy roads, and there are a lot of gormless pedestrians in your path; certainly not suitable for doing sprint training on. If you just want somewhere you can get outside and build-up a bit of a sweat though, then I've run on worse. Once you're out of the city centre, most of the roads here are runnable.

<ImageGallery images={runningImages} />

## Being sociable in Pattaya

There's nothing I found in Pattaya in the way of events designed to meet new people. That's the bad news, but the good news is that you don't need them. Especially if you're a man and you're alone, you are not going to have a hard time meeting people. So long as you're the one buying, this is an entire city of girls (or guys) who're willing to drink with you. Just try not to fall in love and join the flying club.

While Pattaya does have distinctively-named areas, such as walking street, the truth is that all these areas blend-into one. There's bars all the way between them, so where one area ends and another begins is very subjective.

Personally I don't like the walking street area. It's very money-grabby and feels very scammy. This is the best known bar area so is the first place that most tourists head to, and as such has a lot of gullible fools ready to be parted from their fortune. Honestly though, there are good bars and scammy bars all over the city, so I'd suggest you just have a wander until you find what you're looking for and somewhere that you feel comfortable.

Don't discount Jomtien either. It's the one place that does have a bit of distance, which means it's a hair more relaxed than the rest of Pattaya and you don't get bothered so much.
