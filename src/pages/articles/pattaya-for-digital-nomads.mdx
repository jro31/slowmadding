If you've spent any time in Thailand, and perhaps even if you haven't, you'll be aware of Pattaya's rather sordid reputation. And it's fully justified. The breadth of bars here is mind-blowing and numbers somewhere in the thousands, with some being open 24 hours per day. The number of massage shops isn't too far behind.

While the foreigners who choose to call Pattaya home are generally elderly men who prefer to fraternise with women who would be far too young and attractive to be attainable almost anywhere else in the world, temporary visitors to Pattaya come from far and wide and from all walks of life. It's a city so overrun with tourism that little here has any semblance of Thailand. If you've come to experience local culture, then forget all about coming to Pattaya.

That travellers so inexperienced flock to Pattaya goes some way to explain the Pattaya Flying Club, whose innumerable members made up almost exclusively of men, come to Pattaya and commit suicide by jumping off their hotel balconies. Naive men of all ages thinking they've found the perfect girl who's fallen in love with them.

Newsflash: You haven't.

The women here will say and do what they have to so that as much money as possible in your bank account, ends up in their bank account, and when the money is gone, so are they. With no money left and no girl either, it's time to join the Pattaya Flying Club.

This seems very obvious to me and I think would be to anyone who's travelled a bit. As sad as this sounds, I treat any girl who approaches me in South-East Asia as only talking to me for money. There are some guys who just don't understand the game being played, fall in love, and then fall off a balcony. It's the dark-side of Pattaya that the tourist brochures don't mention. Don't come here and become one of the statistics.

While Pattaya's reputation is for sex tourism, and you won't be able to avoid that happens here, a lot, if you just want to go to the beach and drink in the evenings, you can still have a great time. There are some nice beaches and you won't be approached by working girls in every bar (just most of them).

If you don't plan on drinking or partying at all, then I'd suggest that Pattaya isn't for you. That doesn't mean that you won't find anything here of interest; some local people come to Pattaya for family holidays. It's just that you'll likely find whatever it is you're looking for in other cities in Thailand, but without all the parties and sex tourism.

Usual rules of physical contact don't apply in Pattaya. Walking alone as a man you will be grabbed everywhere by girls with concerning regularity in the busier areas. In the gay area, men do it, so that was a fun surprise.

If you do come here though, just be aware of what you're coming to. You won't find any Land of Smiles bullshit. It's the sex tourism capital of the world, and whether you wish to partake or not, you're not going to be able to escape that fact.

## Who is Pattaya suitable for?

When I go somewhere as a digital nomad, I typically like to stay there for a while so I can really get to know the place. I don't recommend doing that here. I've been to Pattaya three times, each for roughly two weeks, and on every occasion I've been very glad to again leave.

Coming here and not partying is a little futile, and after two weeks caught in flux between drunk and hungover, you need to get away, sober up, and start working on losing the bitch-tits. You'll have spent way more money than elsewhere in Thailand, and will have probably been far less productive.

I'd really only recommend it to anyone, particularly men, who want to let loose and have some fun for a bit.

Don't come here if you're trying to get into shape, because there's a lot of beer to be drunk. Don't come here if you need to be productive, because even if you're not drunk you're going to be hungover. Don't come here if you have no interest in partying. I can't imagine how awful Pattaya is sober. Just come here, for a short amount of time, when you need to just say fuck it, I'm going to have some fun.

## How affordable is Pattaya?

You'll find Pattaya to be slightly cheaper than Bangkok, but not by much. The beer is a little cheaper - roughly 80 baht for a 330ml bottle of local beer, although walk around and you'll find all night happy hours where it'll be 60 baht or less. I've paid around 1,200 baht per night for my accommodation each time I've been here, always staying in one-bedroom apartments. At tourist-focussed restaurants, expect about 150 baht for a plate of food.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Pattaya?

Yes, little in Pattaya represents Thailand. People speak to you in English and all signs and menus are in English.

## Is Pattaya safe?

Pattaya attracts people, mostly men, from many different cultures, and they're all drunk. You'll likely see more than one bar fight when you come here. Other than that and being or being landed on by one of the many flying club inducties, it's a perfectly safe place.

## How is the Internet in Pattaya?

Utter shit. I don't know if it's just the places I've stayed or if it's a city-wide phenomenom, but in a country known for its fast Internet, it's staggering how bad the Internet is in Pattaya. If a fast connection is important for you, then I'd spend some time researching the speeds of where you plan to stay before booking.

## Understanding the layout of Pattaya

In terms of Pattaya's geography, there are two main areas to be aware of where all of the 'action' happens. The centre of Pattaya stretches roughly from the south end of Pattaya Walking Street, approximately three kilometres until the Terminal 21 shopping mall. From the water's edge to roughly a kilometre inland, these three kilometres are little but bars, clubs and massage shops.

Much less notorious and I think technically not part of Pattaya, Jomtien can also be fun and is easily reached from Pattaya town centre by walking or by baht bus, and is a much more relaxed, less in-your-face alternative, very popular with Russians. It has a good night market and some nice beaches, with a much more sightly waterfront than Pattaya, and as I found out the hard way (not literally), Jomtien Walking Street is Pattaya's very gay gay area.

These are the two 'town centres' in Pattaya, but it's a city so overrun with tourism that by wandering down random side roads, you can often stumble upon little known clusters or even entire streets of bars.

As it's a town that exists basically for partying, if tourists are present in a particular area then you'll usually find bars catering to them.

## How to take a baht bus in Pattaya

Baht buses, also known as songthaews, are named as such because back in the day they only cost one baht. They're those pick-up trucks with a bench on either side of the truck's bed for passengers to sit on, a roof, and a platform at the back for extra passengers to stand on.

You find them all over Thailand, but in many places they're only really used by locals because foreigners can't figure-out where they go. In Pattaya they're more common than any other place I've been and are used by everyone. Particularly if you want to travel between Pattaya and Jomtien, you'll find yourself using them a lot. During the daytime you'll be passed by roughly one per minute on this route.

I believe they run twenty-four hours per day. I've definitely used them to get back to my room after way too many drinks in the middle of the night on multiple occasions. If you're not used to taking them though they can be a little intimidating, so this is how they work.

From the front it can sometimes be a little hard to differentiate them from regular pick-up trucks. It's also hard to tell if they're full until they're stopped next to you, and the driver will happily load-up with as many passengers as are willing to get on. If you're standing on the road looking like someone who might be about to take a baht bus, the driver will typically slow down anyway (which is a bit annoying if you're actually trying to cross the road). And when you want to flag one to stop, you stick your hand out, palm facing down (not like that), and flap your hand up and down to notify the driver that you want to get on.

Once the baht bus has stopped you jump in the back, sitting down if there are seats available or hanging off the back if there aren't. Four people can comfortably stand on the rear platform, but if a baht bus pulls-over and there isn't space, don't feel obligated to get on. You can wave the driver away again.

What will happen occasionally with empty baht buses, is that you'll flag it down, the driver will stop, you'll go to get on, but before you have the driver will speed away again. This happened to me on a couple of occasions, and I was all like... the fuck? I then realised that some of these baht buses also operate as taxis, and if they have no passengers then they're looking for someone they can charge a higher fare to by taking them to a specific location, rather than plying a specific route. So don't be disheartened, it's almost certainly not because you're so repulsive that they don't want you in their truck. Just wait until the next one comes along and try again.

There are nine different routes plied by the baht buses in Pattaya, but most of these operate in the downtown area where everything is in walking distance anyway. Going to Jomtien is when they're most useful, and on Thappraya Road (the road that connects Pattaya to Jomtien), there is only one route, so hail a baht bus here and you know where it's going.

There are no stops. When you want to get off you ring one of the bells and the driver will pull over to the side of the road. Get out and walk to the passenger-side window. Baht buses cost 10 baht per journey, which you hand to the driver (or passenger if there is one) through the window. They have small amounts of change, but I'd recommend avoiding trying to pay with large bills.

That's it really. Because of their price and regularity they're a really good way of getting around Pattaya, particularly when going to Jomtien. If you want to take a baht bus on a road there are multiple routes, you can ask the driver where he's going before getting on, but I normally don't bother. For only 10 baht it's easier to just get on and if at any point he starts going somewhere you don't want to go, get off, pay, and take another baht bus that's going the right way.

## Being sociable in Pattaya

There's nothing I found in Pattaya in the way of events designed to meet new people. That's the bad news, but the good news is that you don't need them. Especially if you're a man and you're alone, you are not going to have a hard time meeting people. So long as you're the one buying, this is an entire city of girls (or guys) who're willing to drink with you. Just try not to fall in love and join the flying club.

While Pattaya does have distinctively-named areas, such as walking street, the truth is that all these areas blend into one. There are bars all the way between them, so where one area ends and another begins is very subjective.

Personally I don't like the walking street area. It's very money-grabby and feels very scammy. This is the best known bar area so is the first place that most tourists head to, and as such has a lot of gullible fools ready to be parted from their fortune. Honestly though, there are good bars and scammy bars all over the city, so I'd suggest you just have a wander until you find what you're looking for and somewhere that you feel comfortable.

Don't discount Jomtien either. It's the one place that does have a bit of distance, which means it's a hair more relaxed than the rest of Pattaya and you don't get bothered so much.

## Shopping in Pattaya

I'll be blunt, I hate shopping. If you ever meet me and notice all my clothes have holes in, it's not because I'm too cheap to replace them, I just hate shopping so much that I'll wear them until they fall off so I don't have to.

That being said, even I need to buy new things occasionally, and Pattaya is quite a good place to do it if you like things to be cheap and easy, which you probably do if you're here.

In amongst all the bars and massage shops, you'll find little shops and markets all over the city and these are all perfectly good places to shop. With so many tourists, there's a lot of competition to part them with their money. But I'm going to recommend two places specficially.

### Central Marina

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/x7X3mR8mdhc1jgJu6'>Central Marina</ExternalLink> is a short walk from Terminal 21, but seems to get largely ignored. Every time I come here it feels pretty much empty. It's got a strange layout, because when you walk in the front entrace you're in this semi-deserted area with a few cafes and not much else. The reason it's so great, is if you go through this area and across a little forecourt, you get to a bigger building that has several factory outlets where you can pick-up some discounted brands.

For example, there's a Nike factory outlet that focusses mainly on shoes, so if you want to get a pair of Nikes for half the price you'd pay elsewhere, come here.

There's also a shop for Puma and one for Adidas and one for Skechers etc.

### Mike Shopping Mall

I'm not sure who came up with the name for <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/HX77RZJtjVNPPkND8'>Mike Shopping Mall</ExternalLink>. Probably Mike. Regardless, the stupid name doesn't detract from the fact it's a good place to come if you want to find some cheap clothes somewhere with air conditioning.

If you've ever been to MBK in Bangkok, it feels very similar. Lots of individual sellers, selling fake or unbranded items. So if you need some new shorts or t-shirts, but don't want to pay designer prices and also don't want to shop in a hot, outdoor market, then come here. You'll probably be able to get what you're looking for.

  {
    src: `${imagePath}/shopping/shoes.jpeg`,
    alt: 'Shoes',
    caption: "When I was in Pattaya in February I bought a pair of shoes from the Nike outlet in Central Marina. By the time I came back in November, they were looking a bit worse for wear, so I went back to the Nike outlet in Central Marina and bought the exact same pair of shoes again. So if you want to know what wearing a pair of shoes everyday for nine months does to them, which I'm sure you do, then here you go. You're welcome.",
  },

## Where to run in Pattaya

My experience of running in Pattaya is that the centre of town is too busy with pedestrians and vehicles to run comfortably, but once you get out of the centre it... could be worse.

### Yinyom Beach

When staying at G Residence (below) which is between Pattaya and Jomtien, my typical run is to leave the building and run down some side roads to <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/2A5fuCyVCx3vdPkU7'>Yinyom Beach</ExternalLink>. From there you can either run along the beach, along the pavement, or along the road south-east until you're in Jomtien.

While this route does have a lot of beach-going tourists on it, it's not quite so busy that it's uncomfortable to run along, so long as you go sufficiently slowly.

Once in Jomtien you can continue along the beachfront as far as you want before cutting down any of the sois to get to Jomtien Second Road. While busy with traffic, Jomtien Second Road and Thappraya Road that it turns into, have pavements all the way along and not too many pedestrians so is relatively comfortable to follow back. It goes all the way back to the centre of Pattaya.

On the one occasion that I stayed closer to the centre of Pattaya, I'd typically run the same route, except I'd started running in the centre of Pattaya as soon as the pedestrians and traffic thinned enough that I could.

It's not an especially great route, you have to cross some busy roads, and there are a lot of gormless pedestrians in your path; certainly not suitable for doing sprint training on. If you just want somewhere you can get outside and build-up a bit of a sweat, then I've run worse. Once you're out of the city centre, most roads here are runnable.

  },
]

<ImageGallery images={yinyomBeachImages} />

### Queen Sirikit Park

The one place that I explored as an alternative to running along the roads and the beach, was Queen Sirikit Park. If you view it on Google Maps <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/2mHHQAp6pXz435hu9'>Satellite view</ExternalLink>, you'll see that it's quite a big area of greenery stretching half-way down Thappraya Rd, all the way to G Residence (my accommodation in Pattaya on two occasions). Because of this I assumed it'd be great for me to go running in, and there must be an entrance somewhere nearby, right? Right?

Despite part of the park stretching to less than 200m from my accommodation, to get into the park I had to walk for 20 minutes, mostly down the side of a pavementless main road, to find an entrance.

Convinced that there must be a nearer entrance, I then started searching from inside the park. In the south-east end of the park you come across a rusted children's playground that's now home to a rather aggressive pack of dogs. It feels akin to a scene from The Last of Us. If you make it through the dogs unscathed and go down some steps, you get to an abandoned car park.

There are a couple of new condo buildings between the car park and the main road, and my guess is that they built these condo buildings on wherever the entrance to this car park used to be, and consequently there's now no way into this park without going all the way around the other side. That kind of ruins it as an option for running if you're staying where I was, because it's a pain to get into.

If you're staying closer to one of its few entrances, then it's a slightly peculiar place. There are deserted roads through much of it, which I did see people running along, and they're a perfectly viable option. There's also a footpath, but this too includes some slightly aggressive dogs, it has collapsed in places, and I discovered what I can only describe as a toilet graveyard, which is always nice when running.

I didn't ever come back here to go running, and stuck to the roads and beaches, but it's an option if you can easily find a way in.

## Where to get vegan food in Pattaya

The vegan scene in Pattaya took a massive hit right before my most recent stay when Yes Vegan, one of only two, and by far the best vegan restaurant in Pattaya shutdown. Despite only one fully-vegan restaurant remaining in Pattaya, the vegan scene here is surprisingly good.

Pattaya attracts tourists from all over the world. There are many Middle-Eastern tourists, and even more Indian tourists. A consequence of that is that tourist areas of Pattaya are overflowing with Middle-Eastern and Indian restaurants. And when it comes to finding vegan food, that's a good thing.

Almost all Middle-Eastern restaurants have vegan options like hummus and falafel, and even non-vegetarian Indian restaurants offer curries, breads and rices that are or can be made vegan. There are so many of these that if you like Middle-Eastern or Indian food then just have a wander around - you don't really need my recommendations.

That being said, I really like <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/rLU4D3LGXuXPCSsS8'>Rubai</ExternalLink>, a Lebanese restaurant in Jomtien. It serves meat and there aren't that many vegan options on the menu, but those there are, including hummus and falafel, are really good and reasonably-priced. Another good bet is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/fZwWzuX7ZSbKjA4PA'>Lebanese House</ExternalLink>. It's located in the food court of The Avenue shopping mall in Central Pattaya. If you don't mind eating in a food court, then the food they serve is excellent.

For Indian food my favourite is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/UwxfQf5PQLzLbLf97'>Jai Jinendra</ExternalLink>. It's a vegetarian restaurant with many, many vegan choices on their huge menu. The staff speak English and understand what vegan means. The chef told me once that he's never eaten meat or egg in his life (he does eat dairy), so he's very sensitive to dietary restrictions.

If you aren't interested in Middle-Eastern or Indian food then your options are far more limited. My favourites are below.

### Five Star J Restaurant

<MapLink name='313/37 S Pattaya Rd' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/oSZXeom9q95eRe3S6' />

Five Star J is a vegetarian, rather than a vegan restaurant, although the majority of items on the huge menu are vegan and are labelled as such.

The menu is honestly a book, it's massive. Perhaps it's dominated slightly by Asian offerings, but there's still plenty of western stuff on there, which I actually recommend a little bit more. I even had two decent pasta dishes here, which is rare. Definitely worth visiting while in Pattaya.

### Babylou Vegan Food and Smoothies

Babylou is a take-away only restaurant on the street that Yes Vegan used to be on. While they do have a premises, you can't eat there, it's just there for collection. Instead you order on <ExternalLink url='https://r.grab.com/g/6-20250402_181004_BC419F460AB34419A467BC9B5354A1F6_MEXMPS-3-C6LTRK4UVFUXNX'>Grab</ExternalLink> and get your meal delivered (search for 'Babylou Vegan Food & Smoothies - Pattaya' if that link doesn't work).

The downside is that the menu on Grab is only in Thai. I had to screenshot the entire thing and use Google Translate. But once you do, the food is excellent, and very reasonably-priced, especially once you tag-on any Grab special offers.

Despite the name, I don't think it's a fully vegan restaurant. I may be wrong because that's based on Google Translate, which isn't 100% accurate. But if you want to believe Google Translate then at least one dish contains egg. The vast majority are vegan and Babylou did a great job of filling the hole left behind by Yes Vegan during my latest visit to Pattaya.

### Apple Vegan Cafe

<MapLink name='Chalerm Phrakiat 18' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/VYqhbCbTm2sp3xHh8' />

Apple was newly opened on my second stay in Pattaya. Being walking distance from Olympus City Garden was part of the reason I decided to stay there.

It's a fully vegan restaurant run by this very sweet lady. It's open Monday to Saturday, and on my first visit when I asked her what time they closed, she responded that the restaurant closes at 10pm, but I could order take-away 24 hours per day. She was the only chef so I quizzed a bit further, and it turns-out that she sleeps in the restaurant, and any time an order comes in, no matter what time of night, she has to get up and head to the kitchen.

I honestly couldn't think of anything worse, but that really is some dedication to making your business work.

The menu is a little limited, but does have some classics that you wouldn't really expect to find on a vegan menu in Thailand. Fish fingers with chips are a meal I can't have had for thirty years, and vegan tuna sandwiches were one of my go-to meals back when I had a kitchen.

It didn't seem to be attracting too many customers when I first came here, so I was glad to see it doing well when I came back to Pattaya nine months later.

<AccommodationTable stays={gResidenceStays} />

Each of my stays at G Residence has been in the mid-sized 'Apartment with Balcony', which is 47m² (they also offer studios at 35m², and two-bedroom apartments is 80m²). It's a very fairly-priced room considering the size, with more than enough if you're travelling alone.

If you're not, then it's worth noting that despite the name, the 'Apartment with Balcony' is more just a large studio. There aren't really separate rooms, so if you want to have a way to get away from someone, then perhaps consider the two-bedroom apartment instead.

My first stay here, coming to Pattaya for the first time, I chose it primarily because the now-closed Yes Vegan was nearby. That was a blessing, because even without Yes Vegan, I love the location.

Pattaya is very much a party town, so my advice would be to avoid staying in the city centre. When you want to travel in for a night out you can, but staying outside gives you the freedom to get away from all the craziness as well. That's what G Residence offers you.

It's located right between the centre of Pattaya and Jomtien. Walk 25 minutes in one direction and you're on Pattaya Walking street, and walk 25 minutes in the other and you're in Jomtien (the baht bus will cut these journeys down to more like 10 minutes). But for as much as it's possible in Pattaya, it's in a much calmer, relaxed area.

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yxDLnLh7mnDroA76'>Food Mart</ExternalLink> supermarket is about a 15 minute walk, and you've got everything else you need (7-11, some lauderettes etc) much closer. It's also quiet enough in this area tht you can comfortable go running right out of the apartment.

In my three stays here, the three rooms each had a different layout, so it's kind of pot-luck which you get, but I was happy in all of them. Each room has plenty of space to exercise, a dining table and chairs to eat or to work at, a sofa (with varying comfortability), a small kitchen (with more equipment that can be borrowed or rented downstairs) and a balcony. The rooms are cleaned daily, and the complex includes a really nice swimming pool (two actually), despite the Russians that sit beside it smoking all day, and a well-equipped gym.

G Residence is an almost perfect place to stay, with one big, big caveat. The wifi here absolutely sucks.

Once you're connected it's mostly useable (a little unstable), but it has a login page where, every time you put your device down, you get logged-out and have to sign-in again. This gets very tedious, even more so if like me you have a device like an Apple TV which requires using your phone to login, to the point that by the end of your stay, you probably won't even use the wifi anymore and just use your phone's data, but even AIS doesn't get great reception in the rooms.

As this website is aimed at digital nomads, and little is more important than a good Internet connection, then it's very hard for me to recommend this place. For me though, despite the nonsensical sign-in page every time you want to use the Internet, it's still a great place to stay for every other reason I've listed here.

I'll probably stay here again when I'm next in Pattaya, and I'll probably get pissed-off at the Internet again, like I always do. But other than that it's a great place to stay.

<AccommodationTable stays={olympusCityGardenStays} />

In the absence of availability at G Residence, I stayed at Olympus City Garden on my second visit to Pattaya. It's an apartment block, so don't make the mistake of thinking that you're staying at a hotel. You're not.

That can be a good thing or a bad thing, but know that through my stay, no one came in to make up the room, no one changed the bedding or the towels, the one toilet roll I was provided with wasn't replenished, the kitchen sink didn't include washing up liquid or even a sponge, there were no spare bin liners and no one came in to change the bins. You're responsible for all this stuff.

The positive is that if you don't like people knowing your business, Olympus City Garden is very private.

There are hundreds of apartments in this complex, and the security, while present, is very much out of the way. You don't have to walk past a reception or a security guard each time you go out and come back like in many places. Here, no one knows if you've come or gone, and no one cares.

I like that. Perhaps highlighting my own insecurities, I hate how in hotels the receptionists know exactly how often I go outside, because on some days, especially on days I'm working, I might only be out for an hour, but then get conscious that they think I'm spending too much time in the room. Here you are free, so take the lack of hotel services as a positive or a negative depending on what you like.

I dealt with someone who works here precisely once during my stay. A guy called Jack met me as I arrived, showed me to the room, and I didn't hear from him or see him again until I checked-out and messaged him to say the room was empty.

As for the room, it's listed as 26m² which makes it almost half the size of the rooms I've had at G Residence, despite being more expensive. The use of space for such a small room is both impressive and depressing, cramming a bedroom with double bed, living room and kitchen including a sofa with coffee table and a table and chairs, and a bathroom, all within these 26m. As impressive as it is to get all that in, it does feel cramped.

I had to move the coffee table next to the front door anytime I wanted to exercise, I had to move one of the chairs just so the other could tuck under the table properly and wasn't in the way, and I stored my suitcase upright just so it wasn't taking up too much of the floor.

The kitchen has the two essentials of a kettle and a (large) fridge, as well as a microwave. Beyond this it's very lacking. Lots of crockery, cutlery, and even a knife and chopping board, but the only pan was a large wok. Oddly enough there was a saucepan lid, there just wasn't the saucepan to go with it.

There are two TVs in the apartment on either side of the sliding bedroom door. Unfortunately they're the only TVs I've encountered since I bought it in 2015, that aren't compatible with my Apple TV. They have HDMI inputs which is what I normally use to connect my Apple TV, and the picture worked fine, but the sound didn't. For some reason I couldn't get the sound to work at all, which made these TV sets obsolete to me and I used my phone to workout instead.

The biggest frustration with staying here though, was that the Internet was slooooow. Unlike at G Residence, there is no login page thankfully. Once you're connected you stayed connected, it's just that the connection is not only unstable, it's too slow to do video calls. To make matters worse, my mobile data (AIS) had a very weak connection in the room.

When I had to make video calls I'd tether to my mobile and put it next to the window where it got the best signal. Even then they were some patchy calls. As a digital nomad, it's pretty damn annoying to be staying somewhere that you can't get a good connection in your room.

The other main difference from G Residence, is that Olympus City Garden is pretty centrally located in Pattaya. You're not quite in the midst of all the bars, but you're not too far away from them either. Take that as a positive or a negative depending on what you like.

There are definitely worse places to be, but no doubt in my mind I've preferred my stays at G Residence.

## Final thoughts

Pattaya is a great holiday destination. It's a terrible digital nomad destination. It's a place you can come for a fun couple of weeks, but it's not a place I could ever imagine living or wanting to stay long-term. Bear that in mind before you decide to come here. And if you do come here, come with your eyes wide open. It can be very expensive to fall in love in Pattaya, and many pay with their lives as well as their wallet. Always remember that there's a game being played.

You have money. They want that money. Those are the only rules. Whatever is said and done that might be considered dishonest, deceptive, or even deceitful elsewhere in the world, is acceptable to that end. All is fair and love and war, so don't say I didn't warn you.

## Do I want to come back again?

Not right now, but I still haven't lost my bitch-tits. I'm not sure anyone wants to come back to Pattaya right after leaving.

Once you've got yourself back in shape and the memories of the hangovers wear-off, a little voice in the back of your head says _"hey, you know what we should do?"_ At that point you decide to come back, so you can regret it all over again.
