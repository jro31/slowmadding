## How to take a baht bus in Pattaya

## Where I stayed

### G Residence

<MapLink name='378/148 Thappraya Road, Soi 15' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/j2GiFYBs2e2TZ4iF7' />

<AccommodationTable details={gResidenceDetails} />

My attitude to staying in towns that have party areas, is that I never stay in the party areas. If I want to party then nothing's stopping me from going there, but when I don't then I want to be away from it.

It was partly just luck, as I mainly stayed here because Yes Vegan is nearby, but the location of G Residence is perfect. It's right in the middle between central Pattaya and Jomtien. You can walk to Pattaya Walking Street in about 25 minutes, or you can walk to central Jomtien in about 25 minutes in the other direction. Hundreds of baht buses ply this route so you'll rarely be waiting more than sixty seconds, and this will cut your journey time to 5 to 10 minutes, so everything is really, really accessible, but you're away from all the craziness for when you want to avoid it.

I found it quiet enough that I could go running right from the entrance to the apartment complex, and <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yxDLnLh7mnDroA76'>Food Mart</ExternalLink> supermarket is about a fifteen minute walk. It's about a five minute walk from G Residence to the nearest 7-11, and a ten minute walk to Yes Vegan, the best vegan restaurant in Pattaya. The street Yes Vegan is on is oddly popular with Russians, but has some other useful businesses. There's a fruit stand there that I often went to after lunch at Yes Vegan to buy fruit for my smoothies.

The apartment itself is pretty great. I stayed in what's listed on booking.com as an 'Apartment with balcony'. At 47m² it's the mid-sized apartment that they offer (a studio is 35m², or a two-bedroom apartment is 80m²), and felt very spacious.

I wouldn't quite call it a one-bedroom as there's not a proper wall between the living area and the bedroom, just a partition. That's fine for me being here on my own, but if you're coming with someone else and want to have a space to get away from them, this might not be sufficient.

It gave me plenty of space to do my morning exercise in front of the TV, has a dining table with a couple of chairs that's good for eating at and to use as a workstation, the sofa is great for lounging around on, the king bed is comfortable and the bedroom has plenty of space around it, there's a balcony with a couple of chairs on it that, if you look to the left, gives you a view of the pool (the view straight ahead is just the side of another building), the wifi is fast and stable, the room is cleaned everyday. Honestly it's hard to find a fault with this place.

If there's one, it's that the kitchen is under-equipped. Crucially it has a kettle, but other than that the cooking equipment leaves a lot to be desired, offering just a frying pan that can be used on the hob. If I'd asked for a saucepan I'm sure that one would have been provided.

I didn't make use of any of the facilities outside of the apartment. Most obvious is the pool, where I continually told myself I'd go for a swim one day or at least sit next to it and read my book. I never did, but it looked nice from a distance. There's apparently a fitness centre here somewhere as well, although I never sought it out. I guess I was just content enough in my room I didn't really feel the need to explore too much.

It's a great place to stay, and I was pretty bummed that it didn't have availability when I made plans to come back to Pattaya.

## Where to get vegan food in Huahin

Usually when a town attracts a lot of western tourism, then a corresponding number of western vegan restaurants also open up. Perhaps due to the type of tourists, that's just not the case in Pattaya, and the vegan scene is actually pretty dire.

In the centre of town there are dozens of Indian and Middle Eastern restaurants, many claiming to be vegetarian, but I still found these to be very vegan-unfriendly. Vegan items aren't marked on the menu, and things you'd typically expect to be vegan, like a falafel wrap, came with mayonnaise in when I ordered it in one of these. I found one slightly more vegan-friendly Lebanese restaurant in Jomtien (<ExternalLink url='https://www.happycow.net/reviews/rubai-restaurant-pattaya-318049/1516533#reviews'>Rubai</ExternalLink>) where the staff understood when I asked what was vegan, and there were a small number of (unmarked) vegan offerings on the menu. I went there multiple times.

There's one Subway restaurant in Jomtien, and a small number dotted-around Pattaya. At the time I was here, they were offering a plant-based chicken sub, so out of desperation I ate at Subway a worrying amount of times too.

I went to two supermarkets; Food Mart in Jomtien and one of the Big C's in Pattaya. Neither had any intentionally vegan items that I found, only vegan things you'd expect like fruits, vegetables, pasta etc. In truth, by the end of my time in Pattaya I was tired of eating at the same places again and again, but there were two places that I went that I'd consider truly vegan-friendly.

### Yes Vegan

By far my most-visited restaurant in Pattaya was Yes Vegan. I went there so much that it got embarrassing walking-in. I got the room I did partly because Yes Vegan was nearby, so I was very glad that it turned-out to be good.

It's a fully-vegan restaurant, if you couldn't tell by the name, and the menu's pretty big, with a mix of western and Asian items. It's on a large premesis down a particularly Russian soi, so there's little worry that there won't be any seating. The service was always fast on the many times I ate here, and I thought the quality was consistently high. Prices vary, but no item on the menu costs more than 185 baht, and you'll typically pay closer to 125 baht.

I'm not a fan of sweets so didn't have any, but they also offer up to six cakes each day, such as red velvet cake and chocolate lava cake if you are into that kind of thing.

If you're staying nearby, this will be your go-to for vegan food in Pattaya. If you're not staying nearby, it's worth travelling to, particularly given how little else is in Pattaya.
