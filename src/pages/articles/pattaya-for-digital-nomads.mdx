If you've spent any time in Thailand, and perhaps even if you haven't, you're probably aware of Pattaya's very sordid reputation. And it's fully justified.

The breadth of bars here in mind-blowing but it surely numbers into the thousands, with some being open 24 hours per day. The number of massage shops doesn't fall too far below.

While the foreigners who choose to call Pattaya home are generally elderly retired men who prefer to fraternise with women who would be far too young and attractive to be attainable almost anywhere else in the world, temporary visitors to Pattaya come from all places and walks of life.

It's a city so overrun with tourism that little here has any semblance of Thailand. If you've come to experience local culture, then forget all about coming to Pattaya.

That travellers so inexperienced with the workings of the world come to Pattaya goes somewhat to explain the Pattaya Flying Club, whose innumerable members came to Pattaya and allegedy commit suicide by jumping off their hotel balcony. Some of the new members always seem a little suspect to me, such as one who joined during my second visit by jumping from a third floor balcony.

If I was intent on suicide and had a third floor room, I think at the very least I'd go up to the rooftop to ensure I was successful and not just paralysed. Regardless, do come here with your eyes wide open. Many of these suicides will be legitimate, with naive men of all ages thinking they've found the perfect girl who's fallen in love with them.

Newsflash: You haven't.

The women here will say and do what they have to so that as much of the money as possible in your bank account, ends up in their bank account, and when the money is gone, so are they. With no money left and no girl either, it's time to join the Pattaya Flying Club.

This seems very obvious to me and I think it would be to any travelled a bit. As sad as this sounds, I treat any girl who approaches me in a bar in South-east Asia as only talking to me for money. Yet there are some who don't understand the game being played, fall in love, and then fall off a balcony.

It's the dark-side of Pattaya that the tourist brochures don't tell you about. Don't become one of them.

While Pattaya's reputation is for sex tourism, and you won't be able to avoid that happens here, a lot, if you just want to go to the beach and drink a bit in the evenings, you can still have a great time. There are some nice beaches and you won't be approached by girls in every bar (just most of them).

If you don't plan on drinking or partying at all, then I'd suggest that Pattaya just isn't for you. I don't regret coming here once, because it really is a unique place, but after a change of plans and the need to kill an extra month in Thailand, I came for my second visit on a whim and regretted doing so.

There's really not that much to do here other than party, so I drank so much during my second stay that I left out-of-shape and unhealthy, and looking back, really didn't have that much fun.

In terms of Pattaya's geography, there are two main areas to be aware of. The centre of Pattaya stretches roughly from the south end of Pattaya Walking Street, approximately three kilometres until the Terminal 21 shopping mall. From the water's edge to roughly a kilometre inland, these three kilometres are little but bars, clubs and massage shops.

I think technically it's not part of Pattaya, but Jomtien can be easily reached by walking or by baht bus, and it a much more relaxed, less in-your-face alternative, popular with Russians for some reason. It has a good night market and some nice beaches, with a much more sightly waterfront that I would go to when running. As I found out the hard way (not literally), Jomtien Walking Street is Pattaya's very gay gay area.

Usual rules of physical contact don't apply in Pattaya. Walking alone as a man, you can expect to girls to randomly grab your junk with concerning regularity in the busier areas. In the gay area, men do it, so that was a fun surprise.

Depite years living in Thailand, I'd always avoided Pattaya because of its reputation. I don't regret coming here, for the first time at least, because it is a very unique place that has to be experienced to be understood. If you do come here though, just be aware of what you're coming to. If you're expecting some Land of Smiles bullshit where you're going to come and see some traditional Thai culture then pull your head out of your arsehole. It's the sex tourism capital of the world, and whether you wish to partake or not, you're not going to be able to escape that fact.

## How to take a baht bus in Pattaya

Baht buses, also known as songthaews, are named as such because back in the day they only cost one baht. They're those pick-up trucks with a bench on either side of the truck's bed for passengers to sit on, a roof, and a platform at the back for extra passengers to stand on.

You find them all over Thailand, but in many places they're only really used by locals because foreigners can't figure-out where they go. In Pattaya they're more common than any other place I've been and are used by everyone. Particularly if you want to travel between Pattaya and Jomtien, you'll find yourself using them a lot. During the daytime you'll be passed by roughly one per minute on this route.

I believe they run twenty-four hours per day. I definitely used them to get back to my room after way too many drinks in the middle of the night. If you're not used to taking them though they can be a little intimidating, so this is how they work.

From the front it can sometimes be a little hard to differentiate them from regular pick-up trucks. It's also hard to tell if they're full until they're stopped next to you, and the driver will happily load-up with as many passengers as are willing to get on. If you're standing on the road, looking like someone who might be about to take a baht bus, the driver will typically slow down anyway (which is a bit annoying if you're actually trying to cross the road). You stick your hand out, palm facing down (not like that), and flap your hand up and down to flag to the driver that you wish to get on.

Once the baht bus has stopped, you jump in the back sitting down if there are seats available, or hanging off the back if there aren't.

Four people can comfortably stand on the rear platform, but if a baht bus pulls-over and there isn't space, don't feel obligated to get on. You can wave the driver away again.

What will happen occasionally with empty baht buses, is that you'll flag it down, the driver will stop, you'll go to get on, but before you have the driver will speed away again.

This happened to me on a couple of occasions, and I was all like... the fuck? What I realised is that some of these baht buses also operate as taxis, and if they have no passengers then they're looking for someone they can charge a higher fare to by taking them to a specific location, and by going to get in without talking to the driver, you indicated that you weren't one.

Don't be disheartened, it's almost certainly not because you're so repulsive that they don't want you in their truck. Just wait until the next one comes along and try again.

There are nine different routes plied by the baht buses in Pattaya, but most of these operate in the downtown area where everything is in walking distance anyway. Going to Jomtien is when they're most useful, and on Thappraya Road (the road that connects Pattaya to Jomtient), there is only one route, so hail a baht bus here and you know you're on the right one.

There are no stops. When you want to get off, you ring one of the bells and the driver will pull over to the side of the road. You get off and walk to the passenger-side window.

Every baht bus I took in Pattaya cost 10 baht. There may be some routes that charge more, but typically you just hand 10 baht through the window. If there's someone in the passenger seat, give it to them, if not give it to the driver.

They have small amounts of change, so it's fine to pay a 10 baht fare with a 20 baht note, but I doubt they'd react so kindly if you tried to pay with bigger bills. If you're short on change, break a note by buying something cheap from the nearest 7-11 before getting on.

And that's it really. Because of their price and regularity, they're a really good way of getting around Pattaya, particularly when going to Jomtien. If you want to take a baht bus on a road there are multiple routes, you could ask the driver before getting on, but I found that, for only 10 baht, I'd just get on and if at any point it started going somewhere I didn't want to go, I'd get off, pay, and take one that was going the right way.

## Where I stayed

### G Residence

<MapLink name='378/148 Thappraya Road, Soi 15' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/j2GiFYBs2e2TZ4iF7' />

<AccommodationTable details={gResidenceDetails} />

My attitude to staying in towns that have party areas, is that I never stay in the party areas. If I want to party then nothing's stopping me from going there, but when I don't then I want to be away from it.

It was partly just luck, as I mainly stayed here because Yes Vegan is nearby, but the location of G Residence is perfect. It's right in the middle between central Pattaya and Jomtien. You can walk to Pattaya Walking Street in about 25 minutes, or you can walk to central Jomtien in about 25 minutes in the other direction. Hundreds of baht buses ply this route so you'll rarely be waiting more than sixty seconds, and this will cut your journey time to 5 to 10 minutes, so everything is really, really accessible, but you're away from all the craziness for when you want to avoid it.

I found it quiet enough that I could go running right from the entrance to the apartment complex, and <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/6yxDLnLh7mnDroA76'>Food Mart</ExternalLink> supermarket is about a fifteen minute walk. It's about a five minute walk from G Residence to the nearest 7-11, and a ten minute walk to Yes Vegan, the best vegan restaurant in Pattaya. The street Yes Vegan is on is oddly popular with Russians, but has some other useful businesses. There's a fruit stand there that I often went to after lunch at Yes Vegan to buy fruit for my smoothies.

The apartment itself is pretty great. I stayed in what's listed on booking.com as an 'Apartment with balcony'. At 47m² it's the mid-sized apartment that they offer (a studio is 35m², or a two-bedroom apartment is 80m²), and felt very spacious.

I wouldn't quite call it a one-bedroom as there's not a proper wall between the living area and the bedroom, just a partition. That's fine for me being here on my own, but if you're coming with someone else and want to have a space to get away from them, this might not be sufficient.

It gave me plenty of space to do my morning exercise in front of the TV, has a dining table with a couple of chairs that's good for eating at and to use as a workstation, the sofa is great for lounging around on, the king bed is comfortable and the bedroom has plenty of space around it, there's a balcony with a couple of chairs on it that, if you look to the left, gives you a view of the pool (the view straight ahead is just the side of another building), the wifi is fast and stable, the room is cleaned everyday. Honestly it's hard to find a fault with this place.

If there's one, it's that the kitchen is under-equipped. Crucially it has a kettle, but other than that the cooking equipment leaves a lot to be desired, offering just a frying pan that can be used on the hob. If I'd asked for a saucepan I'm sure that one would have been provided.

I didn't make use of any of the facilities outside of the apartment. Most obvious is the pool, where I continually told myself I'd go for a swim one day or at least sit next to it and read my book. I never did, but it looked nice from a distance. There's apparently a fitness centre here somewhere as well, although I never sought it out. I guess I was just content enough in my room I didn't really feel the need to explore too much.

It's a great place to stay, and I was pretty bummed that it didn't have availability when I made plans to come back to Pattaya.

## Where to get vegan food in Huahin

Usually when a town attracts a lot of western tourism, then a corresponding number of western vegan restaurants also open up. Perhaps due to the type of tourists, that's just not the case in Pattaya, and the vegan scene is actually pretty dire.

In the centre of town there are dozens of Indian and Middle Eastern restaurants, many claiming to be vegetarian, but I still found these to be very vegan-unfriendly. Vegan items aren't marked on the menu, and things you'd typically expect to be vegan, like a falafel wrap, came with mayonnaise in when I ordered it in one of these. I found one slightly more vegan-friendly Lebanese restaurant in Jomtien (<ExternalLink url='https://www.happycow.net/reviews/rubai-restaurant-pattaya-318049/1516533#reviews'>Rubai</ExternalLink>) where the staff understood when I asked what was vegan, and there were a small number of (unmarked) vegan offerings on the menu. I went there multiple times.

There's one Subway restaurant in Jomtien, and a small number dotted-around Pattaya. At the time I was here, they were offering a plant-based chicken sub, so out of desperation I ate at Subway a worrying amount of times too.

I went to two supermarkets; Food Mart in Jomtien and one of the Big C's in Pattaya. Neither had any intentionally vegan items that I found, only vegan things you'd expect like fruits, vegetables, pasta etc. In truth, by the end of my time in Pattaya I was tired of eating at the same places again and again, but there were two places that I went that I'd consider truly vegan-friendly.

### Yes Vegan

By far my most-visited restaurant in Pattaya was Yes Vegan. I went there so much that it got embarrassing walking-in. I got the room I did partly because Yes Vegan was nearby, so I was very glad that it turned-out to be good.

It's a fully-vegan restaurant, if you couldn't tell by the name, and the menu's pretty big, with a mix of western and Asian items. It's on a large premesis down a particularly Russian soi, so there's little worry that there won't be any seating. The service was always fast on the many times I ate here, and I thought the quality was consistently high. Prices vary, but no item on the menu costs more than 185 baht, and you'll typically pay closer to 125 baht.

I'm not a fan of sweets so didn't have any, but they also offer up to six cakes each day, such as red velvet cake and chocolate lava cake if you are into that kind of thing.

If you're staying nearby, this will be your go-to for vegan food in Pattaya. If you're not staying nearby, it's worth travelling to, particularly given how little else is in Pattaya.
