## Arriving in Budapest

The first thing to note when you arrive at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport, is that the only ATMs in the airport are Euronet ATMs. Euronet ATMs charge high fees. Banks in Hungary do not charge any fees to withdraw cash, even with a foreign card, so I'd advise against withdrawing money at the airport unless absolutely necessary.

Taxis are available at the airport and accept card payments, but a cheaper way to get to the town centre is to take the 100E bus, also known as the <ExternalLink url='https://bkk.hu/en/travel-information/airport-express/'>Airport Express</ExternalLink>. This is what I did when I arrived in Budapest, and it was very easy.

Follow the signs to Public Transportation and you will quickly see a bus with 100E sitting there (if there's not one there, you'll see plenty of signs). This bus costs 2,200 HUF, and you can pay with a bank card by holding it against the card reader just inside the bus doors. At this point, the bank card is your ticket.

There are several (at least four) English-speaking helpers directing gormless foreigners such as myself how to board and pay for the bus, so you really can't fuck it up.

The journey to the town centre takes roughly 40 minutes. It then makes three stops, all pretty close to each other.

The first is at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/EKaPcEH9w1vz5HRY9'>Kálvin tér metro station</ExternalLink>, the second is at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/qQqRx5qP5q8TvJZu7'>Astoria metro station</ExternalLink>, and then lastly it terminates at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GLpCmYsSxuWuXS9f6'>Deák Ferenc tér metro station</ExternalLink>. Unless you're staying out in the middle of nowhere, there will be transport links from one these stops to get you to your room, if its not walkable already.

I got off at Astoria, and from there is was a couple of stops on the metro before I was in easy walking distance of my room.

It's worth noting that the Airport Express is the only transport you can pay directly with your bank card. For details of how to pay for other transportation, see <Link href='#getting-around-budapest'>Getting around Budapest</Link>.

## Getting a SIM card in Budapest

There are three main mobile operators in Hungary: Telekom (you'll also see it refered to as T-Mobile), Vodafone and Yettel. Telekom is the biggest of the three.

Knowing that they typically charge higher prices, I avoided the stores in the airport selling SIMs. My UK SIM had actually found a local network, so for once I was in no rush to get connected. Instead I went to the Telekom store in Westend shopping mall.

After getting into a fight with their ticketing machine, which would only give me a number if I put it into German, I got immediately called up and told the attendant I wanted to get a prepaid SIM card.

_"We've sold out of prepaid SIM cards"_ was her response. _"We'll have some more, maybe on Tuesday."_

_"Oh, is there anywhere else I can try?"_ I asked, meaning are they in stock at any other Telekom stores.

_"Maybe Vodafone or Yettel"_ she replied.

I wandered out of the store slightly aghast that Hungary's biggest mobile network had run-out of SIM cards, but quickly noticed that there was a Vodafone store and a Yettel store almost next door. There were no customers in Yettel, and the staff all looked like they'd had enough of life, so I went into Vodafone. They had someone on the door to do the ticketing machine for me. _"It'll be about a 20 minute wait,"_ he told me.

By this point I was losing my patience, but I waited for what turned-out to be more like 30 minutes before getting called-up. The sales rep needed my passport and email address, but he also asked me what my mother's maiden name was. I've never been asked for that in person before, and as it's used as the security question for so many apps, handing it over made me a little uncomfortable. Hungary was not making getting a SIM an enjoyable process.

Eventually though, for a cost of 6,500 HUF (4,990 for a 20GB data package, the rest allegedly for the cost of the SIM), I had a Hungarian mobile network, including propaganda telling me to download the Vodafone app to manage my account.

_"App not available in your region"_ was the response from the AppStore (my Apple account is registered in the UK). I don't know why I wasn't surprised.

The data package was valid for 30 days, so being unable to top-up via the app I...

## How affordable is Budapest?

In terms of affordability, Budapest is a mid-tier European country. Cheaper than western Europe and Nordic countries, but more expensive than eastern European countries like Romania.

As with anywhere, the majority of my budget went on accommodation. I paid an equivalent of 21,376 HUF per night for my Airbnb. This was very much at the cheaper end of private Airbnbs on offer.

A plate of food in a restaurant costs in the region of 3,500 HUF, a beer around 1,500 HUF, a single journey on public transport is 450 HUF, and I paid 5,000 HUF to get my hair cut.

### Is it worth it?

Short answer: No.

A year prior to coming to Budapest, I spent a month in Bucharest in Romania. I found them to be very similar places in terms of architecture, lifestyle, city layout, social opportunities etc. My accommodation in Bucharest cost just 64% of what I paid for my room in Budapest, and it was a much nicer room. As much as I liked Budapest, there's nothing here that justifies the increase in cost over cheaper EU cities.

If you don't have a reason to come specifically here and are just looking for somewhere to go in Europe or in the EU, then if money is a factor look elsewhere. There's much better value to be had.

## Running in Budapest

The primary reason I chose the accommodation that I did, was that it was right next to the imaginitively name <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/VjTjtzR8mACJDssLA'>City Park</ExternalLink>. While you're free to jog anywhere in this park, at the south-east end is a 2km jogging track. Go around this jogging track and you'll also find a four-lane 200m running track. These were the two places that I did all of my running in Budapest, using the jogging track for slower runs, and the running track to do sprints.

Be warned that this is a public park. Despite signs and basic courtesy telling people that these are for runners only, it is not well respected. You will encounter people with kids, dog walkers, people on bikes and scooters and even people walking along smoking, using the jogging track as a path, despite there being an entire park of more suitable paths that they could go on. And my first time I used the running track to do sprints? Right after I started, a group of parents with a dozen or so children decided that the running track and attached workout equipment would be a great place to let their kids play, despite people running on the track and others working-out. And despite there being a huge playground not very far from there.

You can't fix the collective stupidity of humanity.

If you don't have to be staying within striking distance of City Park, I'd say that the streets of Budapest are all pretty comfortable for running on, even though I didn't do it myself. The pavements are wide and don't really get too busy anywhere, there's not much pollution, and you never have to wait too long when crossing the road. Although be warned that everyone smokes in Budapest, and they do so without regard for other people. The second-hand smoke you breathe while running will be your biggest obstacle.
