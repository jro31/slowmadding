## How affordable is Budapest?

In terms of affordability, Budapest is a mid-tier European country. Cheaper than western Europe and Nordic countries, but more expensive than eastern European countries like Romania.

As with anywhere, the majority of my budget went on accommodation. I paid an equivalent of 21,376 HUF per night for my Airbnb. This was very much at the cheaper end of private Airbnbs on offer.

A plate of food in a restaurant costs in the region of 3,500 HUF, a beer around 1,500 HUF, a single journey on public transport is 450 HUF, and I paid 5,000 HUF to get my hair cut (at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/fWN2b2oq9RkVo7EZ8'>Alrashid Fodrászat</ExternalLink>, which I really recommend).

### Is it worth it?

Short answer: No.

Budapest is very Instagrammable (I hate myself for even saying that). It has beautiful architecture and is a very pretty place. If that matters to you then it may well be worth the cost, but it doesn't matter to me.

When I go somewhere, I find value in things like social opportunities, the amount of green space, how walkable a city is and the overall lifestyle it offers me. In that regard there are far cheaper places in Europe that offer just as much. For example, a year prior to coming to Budapest I spent a month in Bucharest in Romania.

Bucharest is a very similar city in all the ways that matter to me (and even has some stunning architecture of its own), but my accommodation in Bucharest cost just 64% of what I paid in Budapest, and it was a much, much nicer room. For all the positives, there's nothing here that justifies the increase in cost over cheaper EU cities.

## Arriving in Budapest

The first thing to note when you arrive at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport, is that the only ATMs in the airport are Euronet ATMs. Euronet ATMs charge high fees. Banks in Hungary do not charge any fees to withdraw cash, even with a foreign card, so I'd advise against withdrawing money at the airport unless absolutely necessary.

Taxis are available at the airport and accept card payments, but a cheaper way to get to the town centre is to take the 100E bus, also known as the <ExternalLink url='https://bkk.hu/en/travel-information/airport-express/'>Airport Express</ExternalLink>. This is what I did when I arrived in Budapest, and it was very easy.

Follow the signs to Public Transportation and you will quickly see a bus with 100E sitting there (if there's not one there, you'll see plenty of signs). This bus costs 2,200 HUF, and you can pay with a bank card by holding it against the card reader just inside the bus doors. At this point, the bank card is your ticket.

There are several (at least four) English-speaking helpers directing gormless foreigners such as myself how to board and pay for the bus, so you really can't fuck it up.

The journey to the town centre takes roughly 40 minutes. It then makes three stops, all pretty close to each other.

The first is at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/EKaPcEH9w1vz5HRY9'>Kálvin tér metro station</ExternalLink>, the second is at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/qQqRx5qP5q8TvJZu7'>Astoria metro station</ExternalLink>, and then lastly it terminates at the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GLpCmYsSxuWuXS9f6'>Deák Ferenc tér metro station</ExternalLink>. Unless you're staying out in the middle of nowhere, there will be transport links from one these stops to get you to your room, if its not walkable already.

I got off at Astoria, and from there is was a couple of stops on the metro before I was in easy walking distance of my room.

It's worth noting that the Airport Express is the only transport you can pay directly with your bank card. For details of how to pay for other transportation, see <Link href='#getting-around-budapest'>Getting around Budapest</Link>.

## Getting a SIM card in Budapest

There are three main mobile operators in Hungary: Telekom (you'll also see it refered to as T-Mobile), Vodafone and Yettel. Telekom is the biggest of the three.

Knowing that they typically charge higher prices, I avoided the stores in the airport selling SIMs. My UK SIM had actually found a local network, so for once I was in no rush to get connected. Instead I went to the Telekom store in Westend shopping mall.

After getting into a fight with their ticketing machine, which would only give me a number if I put it into German, I got immediately called up and told the attendant I wanted to get a prepaid SIM card.

_"We've sold out of prepaid SIM cards"_ was her response. _"We'll have some more, maybe on Tuesday."_

_"Oh, is there anywhere else I can try?"_ I asked, meaning are they in stock at any other Telekom stores.

_"Maybe Vodafone or Yettel"_ she replied.

I wandered out of the store slightly aghast that Hungary's biggest mobile network had run-out of SIM cards, but quickly noticed that there was a Vodafone store and a Yettel store almost next door. There were no customers in Yettel, and the staff all looked like they'd had enough of life, so I went into Vodafone. They had someone on the door to do the ticketing machine for me. _"It'll be about a 20 minute wait,"_ he told me.

By this point I was losing my patience, but I waited for what turned-out to be more like 30 minutes before getting called-up. The sales rep needed my passport and email address, but he also asked me what my mother's maiden name was. I've never been asked for that in person before, and as it's used as the security question for so many apps, handing it over made me a little uncomfortable. Hungary was not making getting a SIM an enjoyable process.

Eventually though, for a cost of 6,500 HUF (4,990 for a 20GB data package, the rest allegedly for the cost of the SIM), I had a Hungarian mobile network, including propaganda telling me to download the Vodafone app to manage my account.

_"App not available in your region"_ was the response from the AppStore (my Apple account is registered in the UK). I don't know why I wasn't surprised.

The data package was valid for 30 days, so being unable to top-up via the app I...

## Getting around Budapest

The first thing I'll say is that Budapest is a very walkable city. The pavements are wide, crossing the road is easy and any pollution is unnoticeable. This should be your primary mode of transport.

For when you can't be arsed, Budapest's public transport network is the best I've ever seen from an outsider's perspective and is very easy to use, with the exception of there being a bit of a learning curve.

I never take taxis because I'm not a millionaire, but Bolt seems to be the ride-hailing app of choice here - I saw more cars with 'Bolt' plastered on than any other service, but Uber also has a presence, and do other services I've never heard of before.

### Public transport

So why is public transport here so good from an outsider's perspective? Because the <ExternalLink url='https://bkk.hu/en/tickets-and-passes/budapestgo/'>BudapestGO</ExternalLink> app is so good. And why is there a learning curve? Because you have to know to validate a ticket before boarding any bus, tram or metro train, and if you don't, you're in violation even if you have bought a ticket.

The above link goes to the BKK website, which includes tutorials (and even videos) in English about how to take public transport, so I'll keep my own description brief, but as an overview:

- You need to buy a ticket **before** boarding any bus, tram or metro train, and there are two kinds of tickets:
  - Paper tickets
  - Electronic tickets
- Paper tickets can be bought at ticket machines in metro stations, and at _some_ bus and tram stops, but certainly not all.
- Elecronic tickets can be bought through the BudapestGO app.
- As well as single journey tickets, blocks of 10 single journey tickets (for a slight discount), passes, and 30/90 minute tickets (where you can take an unlimited number of journeys within the time-limit). For simplicity's sake, I'm only going to focus on single journey tickets here.
- Regardless of whether you buy a paper or an electronic ticket, you **must validate the ticket before starting your journey**.
  - This is the part that takes a bit of getting used to. In most other cities, if you buy a ticket from a machine in a metro station and get on a train, your ticket is valid. Here your ticket is not valid until it's been validated.
- For paper tickets, validating your ticket means putting it into the validation machine and waiting for it to stamp the ticket. At metro stations you do this before going down into the station (somewhere close to the ticket machine). On buses/trams there will be a validation machine on board near every door, and you should do so as soon as you get on.
- For electronic tickets on the BudapestGO app, once you've purchased a ticket through the app, you'll see that your ticket has a 'Validate' button. Tap this button to open up a QR code scanner. In metro stations, you'll find a QR code somewhere around the ticket validation machine, on buses and trams, **the QR code is is outside the vehicle, next to the door** (this took me a little while to figure-out). You must scan this QR code, and if successful, a seemingly random image will appear on screen with a caption of 'Full Fare'.
- The next point of confusion, is that once you have validated your ticket, **it is valid for that bus/tram only** - if your journey consists of multiple buses/trams, then you must buy and validate mutliple tickets (unless you're using timed tickets, in which case you still need to validate your ticket for each vehicle). This is not true of the metro. On the metro your ticket is valid until you leave a metro station, so you can transfer and take multiple trains on a single ticket.

It all sounds a bit of a pain and, like I said, there's a bit of a learning curve. My suggestion is to not even bother with paper tickets. So long as you have a reliable Internet connection, then the BudapestGO app is honestly a joy to use. I never had issues buying tickets and the QR code scanner to validate my tickets worked in a fraction of a second each time. While both being great, neither are the reason I loved this app so much.

The reason I thought it was so great, is it offers a service more comprehensive than Google Maps for getting around and for taking public transport. You can save as many places as you want (for example, the Airbnb you're staying at), and then from wherever you are in Budapest, go onto the app, tell it where you want to go, and it'll generate a choice of routes that include walking, buses, trams and metro trains to get you there both as quickly as possible, and as cheaply as possible. There's even a button to say that you're already in a vehicle, and it will give you a map and the times of where this vehicle is going to go before it reaches your destination.

In most cities in the world, metro trains are fairly usable by outsiders, but buses are a pain the arse to figure-out.

Not in Budapest, they have done a phenomenal job of making the entire transport network accessible, with the exception of having to learn how to validate tickets. Once you've got that figured-out, getting around Budapest is really, really easy.

## Things I didn't like about Budapest

### Smoking

I'll preface this by saying that I have an unhealthy hatred of smoking. To me, if you smoke you're an idiot, if you smoke in public you're a prick, and if you smoke around people that're exercising, for example by walking along a running track with a cigarette in your hand, then no words do justice to the disdain have for you.

With that out of the way, everyone in Budapest smokes, which doesn't put the locals in great stead in my mind.

Thankfully it's banned indoors, but forget about sitting outside at a restaurant or a bar if you want a smoke-free meal, and when you go to the park, be fully prepared for someone sitting down at the bench next to you and lighting a cigarette.

It's a great stain on the experience you have here.

    alt: 'A tram at Astoria',
    caption: 'No other picture I took sums-up Budapest quite so well.',
  },
]

<ImageGallery images={smokingImages} />

### Drug addiction/Homelessness

It does, I'm sure, sound a little insensitive to voice displeasure at the homeless, but I've grouped it in with drug addiction because in many cases they're one and the same. You get Homelessness of people who've just run-out of money, and you get homeless of people who, through drugs or not, are out of their minds. In Budapest it's the latter.

In some particular areas, for example outside Budapest-Keleti train station, it's far more evident than in others, but in truth you can go all over the city and see people that're not getting the social support that they need.

### Paying to use the toilet

Before coming to Budapest I'd never been to a shopping mall where you had to pay to use the toilet before. Here it's almost all of them.

My guess is it's in response to the levels of homelessness, but it's a pain in the arse, particularly at places that only accept cash, when everything else in Budapest you can pay for by card.

## Running in Budapest

The primary reason I chose the accommodation that I did, was that it was right next to the imaginitively name <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/VjTjtzR8mACJDssLA'>City Park</ExternalLink>. While you're free to jog anywhere in this park, at the south-east end is a 2km jogging track. Go around this jogging track and you'll also find a four-lane 200m running track. These were the two places that I did all of my running in Budapest, using the jogging track for slower runs, and the running track to do sprints.

Be warned that this is a public park. Despite signs and basic courtesy telling people that these are for runners only, it is not well respected. You will encounter people with kids, dog walkers, people on bikes and scooters and even people walking along smoking, using the jogging track as a path, despite there being an entire park of more suitable paths that they could go on. And my first time I used the running track to do sprints? Right after I started, a group of parents with a dozen or so children decided that the running track and attached workout equipment would be a great place to let their kids play, despite people running on the track and others working-out. And despite there being a huge playground not very far from there.

You can't fix the collective stupidity of humanity.

If you don't have to be staying within striking distance of City Park, I'd say that the streets of Budapest are all pretty comfortable for running on, even though I didn't do it myself. The pavements are wide and don't really get too busy anywhere, there's not much pollution, and you never have to wait too long when crossing the road. Although be warned that everyone smokes in Budapest, and they do so without regard for other people. The second-hand smoke you breathe while running will be your biggest obstacle.
