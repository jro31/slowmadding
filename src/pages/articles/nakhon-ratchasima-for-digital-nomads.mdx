  title: 'Nakhon Ratchasima for Digital Nomads',

Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is the third largest city in Thailand in terms of urban population (behind Bangkok and Chiang Mai), making it the largest city in Isaan.

Given the number of foreign tourists that visit Thailand (over 35 million in 2024), it's is a very curious place. Being the third largest city in the country you'd expect it to get at least some spill-over of all the crowds flocking to the islands or up to Chiang Mai, but there's none. There's basically no tourist industry here at all.

Foreign faces, particularly younger foreign faces (below 40) are so rare here, that I garnered a degree of attention sometimes just walking down the street, particularly when I wandered off down small side roads, which I have a tendency of doing. Some people shouting 'Hello' at me from their rooms or from their motorbikes, excited that they got to share their fledgling knowledge of English, others staring like they'd seen an alien.

Because of that lack of a tourist industry, it took me a little while to settle into Nakhon Ratchasima in the sense of it feeling like a place I belonged. In tourist-heavy places, you'll be beckoned, shouted to and, and sometimes even dragged into bars and restaurants and massage shops. And while the motivation for that may be nothing but money, it's still nice to be welcomed, even as a walking wallet. Here though, it's the opposite. While everyone I encountered was more than friendly eventually, at times you'd see a mortified look on some staff member's faces as you approached them in a shop or restaurant. Speaking to them in Thai always made that look go away.

After a few days in Korat though, I'd established my regular restaurants and my favourite bar and had become a familiar face and got to know the people a bit. That was the point I started enjoying it here. Compared to touristy cities where you're pre-loved for your money, it took a bit of time.

## Who is Nakhon Ratchasima suitable for?

Given what I said above, I'd say that Nakhon Ratchasima is more suited to people who have the time to get to know it as a city. Coming here for three days would have been futile for me, because I wouldn't have felt remotely settled by then. If you're an extroverted person, which I am not, then you can perhaps expedite the process a bit, but I'd still recommend giving it at least a couple of weeks.

It's also not a place for the socially-needy. I'll get into having a social life (or a lack of one) below, but you're most likely going to be spending a lot of time alone, and almost every other foreigner you encounter here will be a heavy drinking male above the age of 60.

## Why does it have two names?

This city, and the province of which it's the capital, are known both as Nakhon Ratchasima and as Korat.

Korat is the name used in everyday conversation. If you want to say to a local person that you're coming here, then you'd tell them that you're going to Korat (you'll sound a bit odd saying that you're going to Nakhon Ratchasima).

Nakhon Ratchasima is the official name. It's what you see on Google Maps and it's what's printed on your train ticket when you come here.

That begs the question. Why does it have two names?

The older of the two names is Korat. It evolved from the name Sima, which in ancient Sanskrit means border/frontier, as an early settlement was a frontier town during the Dvaravati period (6th to 11th centuries).

The name Nakhon Ratchasima was introduced in the 17th century. It translates to 'Great City of the King of Siam', and was given to reflect the city's importance as a stronghold at the eastern edge of the Ayutthaya kingdom.

Despite officially being called Nakhon Ratchasima since then, for more than 300 years people have been all 'fuck that, we'll call it what we want,' and out a stubborness that I respect, continue to call it Korat to this day.

A more modern equivalent is how in Vietnam Saigon is known as Saigon to everyone, but its official name is Ho Chi Minh City and the government refuses to let that go.

## How affordable is Nakhon Ratchasima?

It's dirt cheap. While my hotel was close to 1,000 baht per night (more than this during my first visit), it's certainly not necessary to pay so much for a bed in Korat. In fact, the hotel next to mine has 'Hotel 400B' painted in large blue letters on the side, as all classy hotels do. Meals in local restaurants start at 40 baht.

    alt: '400 baht hotel next to Romyen',
    caption: '"Hotel 400B"',
  },
]

<ImageGallery images={affordabilityImages} />

## Is Nakhon Ratchasima safe?

100%. As with anywhere in Thailand, pedestrians are few and far between as locals opt for literally anything other than walking. Therefore, going down quiet side roads the soi dogs can be a bit territorial, particularly if you're running. That's about as bad as it gets here.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Nakhon Ratchasima?

Certainly don't expect English to be spoken - it often won't be. In particular at the local places that I ate, the staff didn't speak any English, so if you speak Thai it'll make life easier. Even if you don't, the people are very patient and welcoming, so caveman noises and sign language will probably be sufficient to get your point across.

## Things I don't like about Nakhon Ratchasima

TODO: Omit this section?

- Uninspiring nightlife
- Little variation of vegan food
- No other 'young' foreigners

## Being sociable in Nakhon Ratchasima

Foreigner-central in Korat is a bar called <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/dSMAMfZTYoajNx358'>Monkey Bar</ExternalLink>. If you want to go somewhere where there's more white faces than Thai, and where everything is in English, then this is the place for you. I came here one time. I didn't really enjoy it.

The customers are primarily retired male expats, many of whom look like they regret their life choices, and the staff are all young Thai girls who look like they're in the process of regretting theirs. The vibe is just a bit weird.

It's basically the only foreigner-aimed bar in the city though, so if that's what you're looking for you're kind of stuck with it. There's also a newly opened is a bar called <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ur5UjWbxrSJUiWcE6'>Hole in One</ExternalLink>. I never made it there, but it's perhaps worth checking-out.

What I enjoyed more about Korat, is that there's a surprising number of craft beer bars. And while the price of a beer in these may be more than double what you'll pay for a generic local beer, I enjoyed working my way through them. My favourite was a bar called <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/W3he4idcmdndSgK57'>Must So Kiss</ExternalLink>. I never understand the names of craft beer places - it seems to just be a competition to out-weird any other craft beer bar names. Ignore the name, there's nothing sexual about this place at all, and I found it was a really nice place to come and have a drink.

For most of my time sitting at the bar here I was the only customer, but that worked quite well because the barmaid spoke English to a similar level as my Thai, so we both got a chance to practice and she taught me a lot about Korat.

Wandering around the city you'll find a few other craft been shops, such as <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/ocseaYWh9hmSRqDy8'>Some Might Say</ExternalLink> (the same owner as Must So Kiss), or <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/dX54Shw6tWxzusmU7'>Tin's Thing Brewery</ExternalLink>. And you know what I learned while here? I don't get hangovers when I drink craft beer. That was quite a revelation.

If you're not into going to bars alone (weirdo), there are no Meetup events in Korat, but there is an <ExternalLink url='https://www.facebook.com/share/9zsrEmH4EEvahEUf'>Expats in Korat / Nakhon Ratchasima</ExternalLink> Facebook group. Events get posted on there occasionally, so give that a look and you might get lucky.

Waking up with a clear head, feeling spritely on both occasions taught me a valuable lesson: I don't get hungover on craft beers. Worth the extra money for sure.",

## Where to run in Nakhon Ratchasima

All of my runs in Korat have been at <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/udgpDHDPhjVxAT1d6'>Bung Ta Lua Park</ExternalLink>. It's a lake with a circumference of just over 3km. It has a wide running path on the outside, and a separated cycle path on the inside. That's nice and all, but as I've done all my runs in the middle of the day, I've had pretty much the whole lake to myself anyway. And if you're feeling greedy, there's <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/S9uSVtoWwyikrn5D9'>another lake</ExternalLink> right next to it that'll add about an extra kilometre onto your route, although you have to cross a road to get to it.

There's something army-related next to the lake. Perhaps a barracks, because you'll often see army-looking people doing drills in and around some of the buildings off to the side of the lake, and I think they're also responsible for its maintenance, because army-dressed people will sometimes be out cutting the grass and emptying the bins.

There also must be an air force base somewhere in Korat, because it's very common to see fighter jets pissing around in the skies above the lake. It's quite fun to watch actually, because they'll be flying upside down and stuff, but it doesn't half make a racket. When they're out, you'll be able to hear these planes from all over Korat, but they seem to particularly like flying over the lake.

The only negative about running at this lake is it isn't that easy to get to. From my hotel I'd walk down this soi of which I don't think they ever get foreigners, because I'd get a wide mix of reactions [elaborate?]. The first time, I decided to jog to the lake, and down this soi I got chased by a couple of dogs, from which thereafter, I walked until I got to the lake. While it is possible to get here on main roads, from where I was staying, it would have added a bit onto my journey.

If Bang Ta Lua isn't convenient for you, consider the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/yejjHik5LR3B99C39'>Nakhon Ratchasima Municipal Sport Stadium</ExternalLink>. I didn't run here as it was further from my hotel than the lake, but from what I can see it's a public stadium that includes a running track, so should also be viable.

    alt: 'Bung Ta Lua Park',
    caption: "Even if you're not running, Bung Ta Lua Park is a nice place to come for a walk. I found that I could just about fit walking to and around the lake on my lunch break.",

## Getting vegan food in Nakhon Ratchasima

TODO: Update this

To my knowledge, there are no late night restaurants that serve vegan food in Nakhon Ratchasima, so the routine I got into was to have one hot meal per day for lunch. The reason I was so thankful to have a microwave and a fridge in my room, is in the evenings I'd have one or two vegan frozen meals that I'd store in my fridge's ice compartment.

Most 7-11s offer at least one vegan frozen meal, with bigger branches offering up to four, and while they can heat them up for you in store, I prefer to take them home to heat-up when I want. The limited variety of the 7-11 frozen meals would have got tiresome though. Here's how I got by.

### Vegetarian Food For Health

<MapLink name='60/1 Suranari Rd' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q2h8CDdfw8Cm2smP9' />

I happened upon this restaurant just by wandering around, but it became the closest thing that I had to a 'go-to' in Nakhon Ratchasima.

It's your typical local 'jay' buffet restaurant (meaning that it's fully vegan) with a point-and-hope buffet, but I didn't get anything I didn't like. Everything they sell is available as take away, and they have plenty of items already pre-packaged, so after getting my lunch, I'd usually get something else to take with me that I'd have as part of my dinner.

Three choices from the buffet with rice costs 45 baht, and the take away items I got were typically 30 baht.

Not a word of English is spoken so we had to communicate in Thai, but they were very patient with me while I slowly interpreted the things they said, and all interactions were conducted with a smile.

They only have four tables, but often I'd find myself the only customer, and never did I have to share a table with anyone else. Thank God.

### Terminal 21

<MapLink name='Thanon Mittraphap' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/vKHPScdYfEMVVRb39' />

Terminal 21 was the other place in Korat that served my vegan needs. I bought food from four different places, but as they're all within Terminal 21 I'm going to group them all together.

Firstly, in the Pier 21 food court on the fourth floor is a vegetarian (note, not vegan) food kiosk. I stress that it's not vegan because on one my visits I got three things from the buffet only to sit down and on closer inspection, realise one of them was made with egg. Which was shit.

While it's primarily a point-and-hope buffet, they do also offer some food made to order.

If you've made it to Nakhon Ratchasima, then I'd assume by now you're familiar with the way that Terminal 21 (and many other large shopping mall) food courts work in Thailand, but just in case you're not, you have to firstly go to the counter where two or three girls (it's always girls for some reason) are sitting, and get a card with some credit on. Just hand-over as much money as you want to top-up; you don't need to say anything. I typically add 200 baht, but you'll do well to spend more than 100 given how cheap these food courts are. Then when you go to any of the kiosks, you hand-over this card to pay; you cannot pay with cash. Once you've finished your meal, go back to the counter where you got your card, hand it back over, and you'll be refunded any money remaining.

The vegetarian kiosk is fairly bog-standard, but it's good enough and it's cheap. Rice with three choices from the buffet costs 44 baht.

Within the same food court (so you'll need to pay with the same card and cannot pay with cash) is a fresh fruit vendor, who sells bags of the usual fruits (watermelon, pappaya, pineapple etc) at 17 baht each. I typically buy these from street vendors, but the one fruit vendor I went to in Korat gave me what I can only assume are foreigner prices.

Typically, even in Bangkok, you'll never spend more than 20 baht on any of these fruits, so when the street vendor here charged me 30 baht for a pretty small bag of pineapple, I was all fuck you, I'll buy it from Terminal 21 where it's 17 baht no matter your skin colour.

Down on the ground floor of Terminal 21 they had what I assume was a temporary collection of food stands (it might be permanent), and among these was a vendor selling strawberries at very fair prices. Berries usually cost a fortune in Thailand, so I tend to just not eat them, but here they were selling decent-sized punnets of strawberries for 100 baht, which brightened-up my daily smoothies.

Then lastly in Terminal 21, is the Foodland supermarket, located in the basement. It's worth noting that, despite being within the shopping mall, Foodland is open 24 hours, and there is an outdoor escalator to take you down there (as well as to the 24 hour Jetts Fitness if you fancy a late night workout) after the shopping mall has closed.

The reason I include Foodland, is that within most parts of the supermaket, I could find occasional vegan items. It sells vegan cheese slices, albeit very expensively (149 baht for 7 slices), which are very hard to find in Thailand. It also sells vegan bread, which again is hard to find in Thailand. Almost all bread here is made with either milk or butter. They also have a small (fairly disappointing) selection of fruits and vegetables, as well the vegan items like rice and pasta you'd typically expect to find in a supermarket.

The reason I include it, is for some reason it has the largest selection of vegan frozen meals I've ever encountered anywhere on this side of the world. Seriously, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it.

Just vegan frozen meal after vegan frozen meal. They had more vegan frozen meals than they had non-vegan frozen meals, which kind of makes me think that they've done it by mistake, or the supermarket's buyer has gone rogue.

I don't think I've ever encoutered a frozen section in a mainstream supermarket that has more vegan than non-vegan stuff. So to have it in Korat of all places, where it's otherwise a struggle to find vegan food at all, just seemed odd.

Still, until they realise this place is a vegan goldmine, and I'm sure you can now appreciate why it was so invaluable for me to have both the microwave and the fridge with ice compartment in my room.

For however much the rest of the city is lacking in vegan food, Terminal 21 will keep you alive while you're here.

TODO: Update this

Staying here was a rarity to me, in that I'd call it a proper hotel. It has a concierge, it has room service, it has snacks in the room that they charge you money for if you eat.

I typically don't go for such places because they cost more and I generally don't like them. I ponied-up for this room though, because even though it was noticeably more expensive than other rooms in Korat, there seemed to be a real lack of kettles offered in hotel rooms here, and a kettle is a minimum requirement for me given the amount of tea I drink.

The deluxe king room is the bigger of the two "room" sizes that they offer (37m² vs 33m²), although they also offer apartments where the size goes up from there. And despite the fact the room was filled with snacks I couldn't eat because they were cheaper at 7-11, I actually really liked it.

It had a very comfortable king-sized bed with enough space in front of it to exercise. There's loads of cupboard space, a nice bathroom, a comfortable armchair that I worked from a lot, as well as a desk and a comfortable chair that made a good workstation (although lacking in nearby plugs).

The TV was a bit shit. It's quite small, and the way it's attached to the wall it faces towards the ceiling slightly, so isn't actually that good to watch from bed. And the sound quality was garbage. I had to connect my headphones just so I could hear what I was watching.

Perhaps my biggest frustration was that the room appears to include a kitchen. It has a kitchen surface and a load of drawers and cupboards.

Yep, all the drawers and cupboards are empty. Completely empty. No cutlery, no crockery, absolutely nothing.

If you've ever read the article I wrote about <Link href='/articles/what-to-pack-as-a-digital-nomad'>what to pack as a digital nomad</Link>, you'll know that I carry some emergency kitchenware for when none is provided. In my suitcase I have a knife and a chopping board, a set of cutlery, a collapsible silicone bowl, a proper-sized tea cup, as well as my blender.

Usually when I stay somewhere I'll only need one or two of these items. This was the first place in a while where I needed all of them.

This is the problem with staying somewhere that has room service. They want you to pay for their room service, so don't give you any way of feeding yourself. Well fuck you guys, I brought my own kitchen with me.

I would have actually been happy to order from the restaurant, with the exception of it having absolutely nothing vegan on the menu. There's also a pool and a gym on site, although as I didn't use either, I can't add much more other than to say they're definitely there.

What they do offer in the kitchen is a kettle, a microwave and a fridge (with ice compartment). The kettle is a minimum requirement, but as I'll get to in the section below, the microwave and fridge were also pretty essential, and I was thankful to have them.

Multiple wifi connections reach all corners of the hotel and are fast and reliable, so I have no complaints there, and I really liked the location. You're close enough to Bung Ta Lua Park that you can easily go for a run (see below), Terminal 21 is about a twenty minute walk in the other direction, my favourite vegan restaurant in Nakhon Ratchasima is less than ten minutes walk, and there are a couple of 7-11s and some vendors very close. I couldn't really ask for much more.

It's definitely not the cheapest place in Korat, but take that with a pinch of salt because this city is dirt cheap anyway. I was glad I'd spent the extra money. It was a very comfortable stay.
