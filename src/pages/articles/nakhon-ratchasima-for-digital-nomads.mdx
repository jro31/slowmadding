Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is the third largest city in Thailand (behind Bangkok and Chiang Mai) in terms of urban population, and is the largest in Isaan, yet very few foreign tourists ever visit. Why is that? And what does this city offer for a digital nomad?

While this was technically my third ever visit to Korat, the previous two came in 2012 and were simply to break-up longer trips I was taking. It was the first time I've ever stopped here with the intention of getting to know it as a city.

I came here from Pattaya, and should probably point-out that I partied a lot in Pattaya, and as a result managed to pick-up a pretty nasty cold/flu/covid bug that I brought with me, limiting the scope of what I could do in Nakhon Ratchasima, to not going out socially once.

Still, I spent plenty of time wandering the city and getting to know the feel of it.

It's not quite the most isolated place I've been as a foreigner in Thailand. When I was in Loei earlier this year, I didn't see another foreigner for the entire week, until I was in the airport departure lounge. It's not quite that isolated, but it's only one step above. If you go out for a three hour walk here, you'll perhaps run-into five other foreigners during that time. If you're used to Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai or any other tourist-heavy places, where there will be twenty foreigners in your peripheral vision at any one time, Nakhon Ratchasima will feel a bit of a shock. Very little here is aimed at foreigners, and very little English is spoken.

I really liked it though, if I'm honest. It's a very calm, relaxed place, without much going on. A nice change of pace from Pattaya. Compared to Udon, where I found the local people to be very forward and I'd often have people come and talk to me, here people pretty much left me alone.

Wandering down quiet side-roads by myself, as I do a lot, I did find I got quite a few strange looks in the [vein] of _"what's this weird foreigner doing down our street?"_ And I found that in most cases, if I made eye contact with and acknowledged people, rather than returning that acknowledgement, they'd avert their gaze and walk past me looking uncomfortable.

That wasn't always true. For example, there was a woman always sitting outside her house, down one of the side roads near my hotel. Everytime I walked past here, she'd ask me (in English) _"where you go?"_ and was very smiley and friendly.

Perhaps because of the poor levels of English, I did find that some people (like fruit vendors, people working in local restaurants) looked a little mortified when I approached them, only to relax and start smiling when I started speaking Thai with them, even if it was in my very low-standard, broken Thai. Given the lack of foreigners here, most people, even those in service roles, won't have to speak any English or interact with any foreigners, so it can be a bit of a shock to them when someone like me approaches.

I like that though. I haven't studied any Thai since 2016 and I never got very far. It's only when I'm forced to use it (or when I'm drunk) that I speak any Thai, so I enjoyed that aspect.

One thing I did find is that the Internet is wholly unreliable in Nakhon Ratchasima.

What I mean, is that I have a few resources that I rely on as a digital nomad to provide me with accurate and up-to-date information. More than any other, I rely on Happy Cow to direct me to vegan food, but in Nakhon Ratchasima, I went to the four places listed on Happy Cow that were closest to my room. None of them had received any new photos or reviews since at least 2019, and as it turns-out, none of them exist anymore either. I had a similar experience with other apps I use, so quickly realised that online information about Nakhon Ratchasima is completely out-of-date, and to learn about this city, I was just going to have to wander around and figure things out, like back when I was backpacking, before I owned a smartphone.

It was actually quite fun. My backpacking days are some of the happiest of my life, yet now when I go somewhere new, I figure everything out on my phone before I leave my room. So rarely do I go out just to explore anymore. Nakhon Ratchasima was a throwback to the good old times.

Because nothing here is aimed at foreigners, there's really not that much 'to do'. You won't find many bars or restaurants calling to you in English. There aren't many massage shops. It's just a nice place to be, where you won't get bothered or harrassed, where you can just exist pretty anonymously.

The perfect place to come for a detox, if you've done a bit too much partying in Pattaya.

## Where I stayed

### Romyen Garden Place

Staying here was a rarity to me, in that I'd call it an actual hotel. It has a concierge, it has room service, it includes snacks in my room that they charge me money if I eat.

I typically don't go for such places because they cost more and I generally don't like them. I ponied-up for this room though, because even though it was noticeably more expensive than other rooms in Korat, there seemed to be a real lack of kettles offered in hotel rooms here, and a kettle is a minimum requirement for me, given the amount of tea I drink.

The deluxe king room is the bigger of the two "room" sizes that they offer (37m² vs 33m²), although they also offer apartments, where the size goes way up from there. And despite the fact the room was filled with snacks I couldn't eat because they were cheaper at 7-11, I actually really liked it.

It's a very comfortable king-sized bed, with plenty of space in front of it to exercise. There's loads of cupboard space, a nice bathroom, a comfortable armchair that I worked from a lot, as well as a desk and a comfortable chair that made a good workstation.

The TV was a bit shit. It's quite small, and the way it's attached to the wall, it faces towards the ceiling slightly, so isn't actually that good to watch from bed, and the sound quality is garbage. I had to connect my headphones, just so I could hear what I was watching.

Perhaps the biggest frustration was that the room appears to include a kitchen. It has a kitchen surface and a load of drawers and cupboards.

Yep, all the drawers and cupboards are empty. Completely empty. No cutlery, no crockery, absolutely nothing.

If you've ever read the article I wrote about <Link href='/articles/what-to-pack-as-a-digital-nomad'>what to pack as a digital nomad</Link>, you'll know that I carry some emergency kitchenware for when none is provided. In my suitcase I have a knife and a chopping board, a set of cutlery, a collapsible silicone bowl, as well as my blender.

Usually I'll only need one or two of these items. This was the first place where I needed all of them.

This is the problem with staying somewhere that has room service. They want you to pay for their room service. Well fuck you guys, I brought my own kitchenware with me.

I would have actually been happy to order from the restaurant, with the exception of them having absolutely nothing vegan on the menu. There's also a pool and a gym on site, although as I didn't use either, I can't add much more comment other than to say that they're definitely there.

What they do offer in the kitchen is a kettle and a microwave. The kettle is a minimum requirement, but as I'll get to in the section below, the microwave was also pretty essential, and I was thankful to have it.

Multiple wifi connections reach all corners of the hotel and are fast and reliable, so I have no complaints there, and I really liked the location. You're close enough to Bung Ta Lua Park that you can easily go for a run there (see below), Terminal 21 is about a twenty minute walk in the other direction, my favourite vegan restaurant in Nakhon Ratchasima is less than ten minutes walk, and there are a couple of 7-11s and some vendors very close. I couldn't really ask for much more.

It's definitely not the cheapest place in Korat, but take that with a pinch of salt because this city is dirt cheap anyway. I was glad I'd spent the extra money. It was a very comfortable stay.
