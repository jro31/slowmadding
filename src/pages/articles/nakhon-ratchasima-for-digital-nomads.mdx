Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is the third largest city in Thailand (behind Bangkok and Chiang Mai) in terms of urban population, and is the largest in Isaan, yet very few foreign tourists ever visit. Why is that? And what does this city offer for a digital nomad?

While this was technically my third ever visit to Korat, the previous two came in 2012 and were simply to break-up longer trips I was taking. It was the first time I've ever stopped here with the intention of getting to know it as a city.

I came here from Pattaya, and should probably point-out that I partied a lot in Pattaya, and as a result managed to pick-up a pretty nasty cold/flu/covid bug that I brought with me, limiting the scope of what I could do in Nakhon Ratchasima, to not going out socially once.

Still, I spent plenty of time wandering the city and getting to know the feel of it.

It's not quite the most isolated place I've been as a foreigner in Thailand. When I was in Loei earlier this year, I didn't see another foreigner for the entire week, until I was in the airport departure lounge. It's not quite that isolated, but it's only one step above. If you go out for a three hour walk here, you'll perhaps run-into five other foreigners during that time. If you're used to Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai or any other tourist-heavy places, where there will be twenty foreigners in your peripheral vision at any one time, Nakhon Ratchasima will feel a bit of a shock. Very little here is aimed at foreigners, and very little English is spoken.

I really liked it though, if I'm honest. It's a very calm, relaxed place, without much going on. A nice change of pace from Pattaya. Compared to Udon, where I found the local people to be very forward and I'd often have people come and talk to me, here people pretty much left me alone.

Wandering down quiet side-roads by myself, as I do a lot, I did find I got quite a few strange looks in the [vein] of _"what's this weird foreigner doing down our street?"_ And I found that in most cases, if I made eye contact with and acknowledged people, rather than returning that acknowledgement, they'd avert their gaze and walk past me looking uncomfortable.

That wasn't always true. For example, there was a woman always sitting outside her house, down one of the side roads near my hotel. Everytime I walked past here, she'd ask me (in English) _"where you go?"_ and was very smiley and friendly.

Perhaps because of the poor levels of English, I did find that some people (like fruit vendors, people working in local restaurants) looked a little mortified when I approached them, only to relax and start smiling when I started speaking Thai with them, even if it was in my very low-standard, broken Thai. Given the lack of foreigners here, most people, even those in service roles, won't have to speak any English or interact with any foreigners, so it can be a bit of a shock to them when someone like me approaches.

I like that though. I haven't studied any Thai since 2016 and I never got very far. It's only when I'm forced to use it (or when I'm drunk) that I speak any Thai, so I enjoyed that aspect.

One thing I did find is that the Internet is wholly unreliable in Nakhon Ratchasima.

What I mean, is that I have a few resources that I rely on as a digital nomad to provide me with accurate and up-to-date information. More than any other, I rely on Happy Cow to direct me to vegan food, but in Nakhon Ratchasima, I went to the four places listed on Happy Cow that were closest to my room. None of them had received any new photos or reviews since at least 2019, and as it turns-out, none of them exist anymore either. I had a similar experience with other apps I use, so quickly realised that online information about Nakhon Ratchasima is completely out-of-date, and to learn about this city, I was just going to have to wander around and figure things out, like back when I was backpacking, before I owned a smartphone.

It was actually quite fun. My backpacking days are some of the happiest of my life, yet now when I go somewhere new, I figure everything out on my phone before I leave my room. So rarely do I go out just to explore anymore. Nakhon Ratchasima was a throwback to the good old times.

Because nothing here is aimed at foreigners, there's really not that much 'to do'. You won't find many bars or restaurants calling to you in English. There aren't many massage shops. It's just a nice place to be, where you won't get bothered or harrassed, where you can just exist pretty anonymously.

The perfect place to come for a detox, if you've done a bit too much partying in Pattaya.
