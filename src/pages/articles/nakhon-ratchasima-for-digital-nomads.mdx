Nakhon Ratchasima, also known as Korat, is the third largest city in Thailand (behind Bangkok and Chiang Mai) in terms of urban population, and is the largest in Isaan, yet very few foreign tourists ever visit. Why is that? And what does this city offer for a digital nomad?

While this was technically my third ever visit to Korat, the previous two came in 2012 and were simply to break-up longer trips I was taking. It was the first time I've ever stopped here with the intention of getting to know it as a city.

I came here from Pattaya, and should probably point-out that I partied a lot in Pattaya, and as a result managed to pick-up a pretty nasty cold/flu/covid bug that I brought with me, limiting the scope of what I could do in Nakhon Ratchasima, to not going out socially once.

Still, I spent plenty of time wandering the city and getting to know the feel of it.

It's not quite the most isolated place I've been as a foreigner in Thailand. When I was in Loei earlier this year, I didn't see another foreigner for the entire week, until I was in the airport departure lounge. It's not quite that isolated, but it's only one step above. If you go out for a three hour walk here, you'll perhaps run-into five other foreigners during that time. If you're used to Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai or any other tourist-heavy places, where there will be twenty foreigners in your peripheral vision at any one time, Nakhon Ratchasima will feel a bit of a shock. Very little here is aimed at foreigners, and very little English is spoken.

I really liked it though, if I'm honest. It's a very calm, relaxed place, without much going on. A nice change of pace from Pattaya. Compared to Udon, where I found the local people to be very forward and I'd often have people come and talk to me, here people pretty much left me alone.

Wandering down quiet side-roads by myself, as I do a lot, I did find I got quite a few strange looks in the [vein] of _"what's this weird foreigner doing down our street?"_ And I found that in most cases, if I made eye contact with and acknowledged people, rather than returning that acknowledgement, they'd avert their gaze and walk past me looking uncomfortable.

That wasn't always true. For example, there was a woman always sitting outside her house, down one of the side roads near my hotel. Everytime I walked past here, she'd ask me (in English) _"where you go?"_ and was very smiley and friendly.

Perhaps because of the poor levels of English, I did find that some people (like fruit vendors, people working in local restaurants) looked a little mortified when I approached them, only to relax and start smiling when I started speaking Thai with them, even if it was in my very low-standard, broken Thai. Given the lack of foreigners here, most people, even those in service roles, won't have to speak any English or interact with any foreigners, so it can be a bit of a shock to them when someone like me approaches.

I like that though. I haven't studied any Thai since 2016 and I never got very far. It's only when I'm forced to use it (or when I'm drunk) that I speak any Thai, so I enjoyed that aspect.

One thing I did find is that the Internet is wholly unreliable in Nakhon Ratchasima.

What I mean, is that I have a few resources that I rely on as a digital nomad to provide me with accurate and up-to-date information. More than any other, I rely on Happy Cow to direct me to vegan food, but in Nakhon Ratchasima, I went to the four places listed on Happy Cow that were closest to my room. None of them had received any new photos or reviews since at least 2019, and as it turns-out, none of them exist anymore either. I had a similar experience with other apps I use, so quickly realised that online information about Nakhon Ratchasima is completely out-of-date, and to learn about this city, I was just going to have to wander around and figure things out, like back when I was backpacking, before I owned a smartphone.

It was actually quite fun. My backpacking days are some of the happiest of my life, yet now when I go somewhere new, I figure everything out on my phone before I leave my room. So rarely do I go out just to explore anymore. Nakhon Ratchasima was a throwback to the good old times.

Because nothing here is aimed at foreigners, there's really not that much 'to do'. You won't find many bars or restaurants calling to you in English. There aren't many massage shops. It's just a nice place to be, where you won't get bothered or harrassed, where you can just exist pretty anonymously.

The perfect place to come for a detox, if you've done a bit too much partying in Pattaya.

## Where I stayed

### Romyen Garden Place

<MapLink name='168/9 Jomsurangyard Rd' url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/JzvgdeGea5YuqzuM7' />

<AccommodationTable details={romyenGardenPlaceDetails} />

Staying here was a rarity to me, in that I'd call it an actual hotel. It has a concierge, it has room service, it includes snacks in my room that they charge me money if I eat.

I typically don't go for such places because they cost more and I generally don't like them. I ponied-up for this room though, because even though it was noticeably more expensive than other rooms in Korat, there seemed to be a real lack of kettles offered in hotel rooms here, and a kettle is a minimum requirement for me, given the amount of tea I drink.

The deluxe king room is the bigger of the two "room" sizes that they offer (37m² vs 33m²), although they also offer apartments, where the size goes way up from there. And despite the fact the room was filled with snacks I couldn't eat because they were cheaper at 7-11, I actually really liked it.

It's a very comfortable king-sized bed, with plenty of space in front of it to exercise. There's loads of cupboard space, a nice bathroom, a comfortable armchair that I worked from a lot, as well as a desk and a comfortable chair that made a good workstation.

The TV was a bit shit. It's quite small, and the way it's attached to the wall, it faces towards the ceiling slightly, so isn't actually that good to watch from bed, and the sound quality is garbage. I had to connect my headphones, just so I could hear what I was watching.

Perhaps the biggest frustration was that the room appears to include a kitchen. It has a kitchen surface and a load of drawers and cupboards.

Yep, all the drawers and cupboards are empty. Completely empty. No cutlery, no crockery, absolutely nothing.

If you've ever read the article I wrote about <Link href='/articles/what-to-pack-as-a-digital-nomad'>what to pack as a digital nomad</Link>, you'll know that I carry some emergency kitchenware for when none is provided. In my suitcase I have a knife and a chopping board, a set of cutlery, a collapsible silicone bowl, as well as my blender.

Usually I'll only need one or two of these items. This was the first place where I needed all of them.

This is the problem with staying somewhere that has room service. They want you to pay for their room service. Well fuck you guys, I brought my own kitchenware with me.

I would have actually been happy to order from the restaurant, with the exception of them having absolutely nothing vegan on the menu. There's also a pool and a gym on site, although as I didn't use either, I can't add much more comment other than to say that they're definitely there.

What they do offer in the kitchen is a kettle, a microwave and a fridge (with ice compartment). The kettle is a minimum requirement, but as I'll get to in the section below, the microwave and fridge were also pretty essential, and I was thankful to have them.

Multiple wifi connections reach all corners of the hotel and are fast and reliable, so I have no complaints there, and I really liked the location. You're close enough to Bung Ta Lua Park that you can easily go for a run there (see below), Terminal 21 is about a twenty minute walk in the other direction, my favourite vegan restaurant in Nakhon Ratchasima is less than ten minutes walk, and there are a couple of 7-11s and some vendors very close. I couldn't really ask for much more.

It's definitely not the cheapest place in Korat, but take that with a pinch of salt because this city is dirt cheap anyway. I was glad I'd spent the extra money. It was a very comfortable stay.

## Where to get vegan food in Nakhon Ratchasima

With Happy Cow proving unreliable, I had to figure-out vegan food in Nakhon Ratchasima for myself. To my knowledge, there is no late night restaurants serving vegan food here, so the routine I got into, was after the morning smoothie I'd make with my blender, I'd get one hot meal per day for lunch. The reason I was so thankful to have a microwave and the fridge in my room, is in the evenings, as well as my evening smoothie, I'd have one or two vegan frozen meals that I'd store in my fridge's ice compartment.

Most 7-11s offer at least one frozen vegan meal, with bigger branches offering up to four, and they can heat them up for you in store. I prefer to take them home to heat-up when I want, but the limited variety of the 7-11 frozen meals would have got tiresome. Here's how I got by.

### Vegetarian Food For Health

Thanks to my intervention, this restaurant now is on Happy Cow. It wasn't before, and I happened upon it just by wandering around, but it became the losest thing that I had to a 'go-to' restaurant in Nakhon Ratchasima.

It's your typical local 'jay' buffet restaurant (meaning that it's fully vegan), with a point-and-hope buffet, but I didn't get anything I didn't like. Everything they sell is available as take away, and they have plenty of items already pre-packaged for take away, so after getting my lunch, I'd usually get something else to take with me that I'd have as part of my dinner.

Three choices from the buffet with rice costs 45 baht, and the take away items I got were typically 30 baht.

Not a word of English is spoken here, so we had to communicate in Thai, but they were very patient with me while I slowly interpreted the things they said, and all interactions were conducted with a smile.

They only have four tables, but often I'd find myself the only customer, and never did I have to share a table with anyone else. Thank God.

### Terminal 21

Terminal 21 was the other place in Korat that served my vegan needs. I bought food from four different places, but as they're all within Terminal 21 I'm going to group them all together.

Firstly, in the Pier 21 food court on the fourth floor is a vegetarian (note, not vegan) food kiosk. I stress that it's not vegan, because on one my visits I got three things from the buffet, only to sit down and on closer inspection, realise one of them was made with egg.

While it's primarily a point-and-hope buffet, they do also offer some food made to order.

If you've made it to Nakhon Ratchasima, then I would assume by now you're familiar with the way that Terminal 21 (and many other large shopping mall) food courts work in Thailand, but just in case you're not, you have to firstly go to the counter where two or three girls (it's always girls for some reason) are sitting, and get a card with some credit on. Just hand-over as much money as you want to top-up; you don't need to say anything. I typically add 200 baht, but you'll do well to spend more than 100 given how cheap these food courts are. Then when you go to any of the kiosks, you hand-over this card to pay; you cannot pay with cash. Once you've finished you meal, go back to the counter where you got your card, hand it back over, and you'll be refunded any money remaining.

The vegetarian kiosk is fairly bog-standard, but it's good enough and it's cheap. Rice with three choices from the buffet costs 44 baht.

Within the same food court (so you'll need to pay with the same card and cannot pay with cash) is a fresh fruit vendor, who sells bags of the usual fruits (watermelon, pappaya, pineapple etc) at 17 baht each. I typically buy these from street vendors, but the one fruit vendor I went to in Korat gave me what I can only assume are foreigner prices.

Typically, even in Bangkok, you'll never spend more than 20 baht on any of these fruits, so when the vendor here charged me 30 baht for a pretty small bag of pineapple, I was all fuck you, I'll buy it from Terminal 21 from now on. 17 baht, no matter your skin colour.

Down on the ground floor of Terminal 21 when I was here, they had what I assume was a temporary collection of food stands (it might be permanent), and among these was a vendor selling strawberries at very fair prices. Berries usually cost a fortune in Thailand, so I tend to just not eat them when I'm here, but here they were selling decent-sized punnets of strawberries for 100 baht, which brightened-up my daily smoothies.

Then lastly in Terminal 21, was the Foodland supermarket, located in the basement. It's worth nothing that, despite being within the shopping mall, Foodland is open 24 hours, and there is an outdoor escalator to take you down there (as well as to the 24 hour Jetts Fitness if you fancy a late night workout) after the shopping mall is closed.

The reason I include Foodland, is that within most parts of the supermaket, I could find occasional vegan items. It sells vegan cheese slices, albeit very expensively (149 baht for 7 slices), which are very hard to find in Thailand. It also sells vegan bread, which again is hard to find in Thailand. Almost all bread here is made with either milk or butter. They also have a small (fairly disappointing) selection of fruits and vegetables, as well the vegan items like pasta you'd typically expect to find in a supermarket.

The reason I include it, is for some reason it has the largest selection of vegan frozen meals I've ever encountered on this side of the world. Seriously, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it.

Just vegan frozen meal after vegan frozen meal. They had more vegan frozen meals than they had non-vegan frozen meals, which kind of makes me think that they've done it by mistake, or the supermarket's buyer has gone rogue.

I don't think I've ever encoutered a frozen section in a supermarked that has more vegan than non-vegan stuff, anywhere in the world. So to have it here, where I really struggled to find vegan food at all, just seems odd.

Still, until they realise, this place is a vegan goldmine, and I'm sure you can now appreciate why it was so invaluable for me to have both the microwave, and the fridge with ice compartment in my room.

For however much the rest of the city is lacking in vegan food, Terminal 21 will keep you alive while you're here.
