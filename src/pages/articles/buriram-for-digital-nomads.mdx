The city of Buriram, capital of the Isaan province of the same name, is located about 120km east of Nakhon Ratchasima. With an urban population about 1/18th the size, my expectations were that it would be less developed and even more local. So it was actually a bit of a shock when I arrived here and found it to be more foreigner-friendly than some of the much bigger cities in Isaan.

I didn't realise it until I arrived, but my hotel was about 150m from the campus of Buriram Rajabhat University. If Wikipedia is to be believed, then Buriram Rajabhat University has around 15,000 students. The population of Buriram is less than 24,000, so this is a very, very student-centric town, which I like. Students are young enough that they haven't become embittered by the world yet, so the vibe here is just really positive. It was the exact opposite of what I was expecting.

## Who is Buriram suitable for?

## How affordable is Buriram?

Buriram is more expensive than you'd expect. As a small city located between Nakhon Ratchasima and Ubon Ratchathani, you'd expect it to be cheaper than them, but it's not the case, and there's actually a small bump in price compared to everywhere else in Isaan I've been.

For example, in Buriram a one-hour massage will typically cost 300 baht. In the rest of Isaan you'd pay 200-250. A small bottle of San Miguel was 99 baht in my most-visited bar here. I'd expect 65 to 80 baht elsewhere. A meal at a local เจ restaurant here cost around 70 baht. An equivalent meal would be 40 to 50 baht elsewhere in Isaan.

These are all pretty insignificant increases in the grand scheme of things, and paying an extra 50 baht for a massage, or an extra 20 baht for a beer isn't going to make much difference unless you're on an extremely tight budget. But if you are, there are cheaper places to be.

## Is Buriram safe?

As you'd expect in a small, studenty town in Isaan, crime is basically non-existent here. The biggest risk I encountered were some rather aggressive soi dogs.

It's something I'm very used to. I walk wherever I go, day or night, no matter where I am in the world, which means I'm very often wandering down side roads and encountering packs of stray dogs. You expect them to be territorial and to bark a bit, but I've never felt as close to actually being attacked as I was walking home here on my first night when I got surrounded by a pack of eight to ten dogs. They were very protective of the road right outside my hotel.

I went out a couple of nights later thinking it would be wise to take a motorcycle taxi back to my room instead of dealing with them again, but then I drank eight beers and decided fuck it, I'll get in a fight with some dogs. I got myself all hyped-up on the 25-minute walk back, and when I got there... they weren't there. They were obviously off trying to intimidate people outside another hotel.

Apart from the dogs, Buriram felt very safe.

## How is the Internet in Buriram?

## Is it easy to get by with English in Buriram?

Frustratingly so. Part of the motivation for the eleven weeks I spent travelling around Isaan was I wanted to be forced to practice my Thai. Perhaps given the high student population here, most people I encountered spoke pretty decent English. Whether buying a train ticket or going to a restaurant or getting a beer, I would in Thai and many people would reply to me in English. It got very annoying.

## Being sociable in Buriram

You won't find any events for meeting new people in Buriram. Or at least I didn't find any events for meeting new people in Buriram. What you will find is more foriegner-aimed bars than in Korat and Ubon Ratchathani combined.

They each only have one bar, so that's not too hard, but still. Dotted around the city you'll find a small number of bars.

One of the better options is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/zsbJf9cPY5PLZmLRA'>Bee Stop Bar and Grill</ExternalLink>. I came here on my first night in Buriram and loved it. I came here again a couple of days later and they changed the TV from the football game I had requested and was mid-way through, because someone else had requested a different game. I didn't appreciate that, so left pretty quickly and didn't come back for a third time. Based on my first night here alone it was a fun bar. Most of the clientel were older foreign men, but that's to be expected anywhere in Isaan.

I also tried <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fdav9eh1C5yy5ZyY6'>Amsterram</ExternalLink>, which as you can probably tell from the name, is a weed themed bar. They sell weed alongside alcohol. I didn't stay for too long here, I found the vibe a bit off. Weed-themed bars are great if you're high, but otherwise the music's just kind of depressing, and everyone in the bar was a bit stand-offish.

If they get the same paranoia I get when I'm high, that's understandable.

Some other bars I bookmarked but never made it to while I was in Buriram, were <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/NgAZrhyCyGRbyLdy6'>Nekromantix</ExternalLink>, which looks like a 90's themed craft beer bar, which is right up my alley. I walked past <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/s6KXmG5ssZLwhcvm7'>2Bars</ExternalLink> on a couple of occasions and it always looked dead, hence I never ventured inside. But hey, perhaps on another night it's good. And <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/65RDDuHDs2V6z63F6'>MarieJane Craft</ExternalLink> is another craft beer bar, which I'd assume by the name also sells weed. <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/8rB9S2h64QwxVTyJA'>Bamboo Bar</ExternalLink> always had foreigners in it drinking, even in the middle of the day, however nothing about it ever made me want to join them, but perhaps it's what you're looking for.

## Things I don't like about Buriram

As I've mentioned above, I've never encountered soi dogs quite as aggressive as they were in Buriram. Although as it didn't happen again, perhaps it was a one-off.

The lack of variety in available vegan food was definitely another frustration, as I'll get to below. I got bored at eating at the same places here, and I only stayed for a week. It would likely stop me from wanting to come here for any longer, particularly if I didn't have a kitchen.

And the last thing that annoyed me a bit here, was how out-of-date or inaccurate Google Maps. It's fairly common outside of major cities for Google to get a few things wrong, but here it felt like there were a load of businesses (including vegan restaurants) that existed on Google Maps that have either since closed down, or were just pure fantasy to begin with. That's always a bit of an annoyance when you plan to go somewhere that doesn't exist.

## Where to run in Buriram

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/GzjdyME3hNzL4j4k6'>Khlong Lalom</ExternalLink> is an 1,800 year old moat that was once dug as a defensive barrier for what is now Buriram. I assume back then it hadn't been disected into five different parts by roads crossing over it, because that would have made it a bit pointless, but that's how it is now.

If you run a full lap of the lake it has a total distance of 5.36km, however the fact that it's cut into sections means that you'll have crossed roads eight different times by the time you get back to your starting point. None of them are especially busy or hard to cross so it's not really as issue on relaxed runs. If you want to come here and do a faster run without crossing any roads, then each of the five sections can be done as a lap on its own. The middle of the five sections is by far the biggest, although worth noting that the people that built the path only knew how to build right-angles, so there are some oddly sharp corners seeing as it's a path meandering around a large lake.

It's a very enjoyable route, it's not very busy, you'll get to see a bit of the city, and you'll also come across sporadic workout areas. I'd also come here to walk on my lunch breaks and do a few pull-ups as the pull-up bars I passed. This is the best option for running in Buriram.

An alternative is the <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/3vRo4VsHTCJpQbyK6'>running track in Buriram Rajabhat University</ExternalLink> (BRU). To look at it on a map, you might think that you can access the stadium from the main road, but you can't. I tried. Unless you're willing to jump a fence, you can only access it from the university campus. Walk until you see a big tree, then behind the big tree is an open gate that leads onto the running track.

I came here in the middle of the day and there wasn't another sole here, because all Thai people are scared of the sun, so you'll likely have the track to yourself. It's an eight-lane 400m track (with a ninth lane on the straight), and is a better choice than Khlong Lalom if you want to do a fast run or sprints.

## Getting vegan food in Buriram

This was definitely my least faviourite thing about Buriram. Freshly cut fruit is readily available from vendors all over the city, more so than anywhere I've been in Thailand apart from Bangkok, so that's helpful. But as for getting an actual meal? I only came across three different options.

As well as the below, you could try <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/8psRhWkm6e3AEbvp7'>Healthy Cafe Buriram</ExternalLink>. They do smoothie bowls made with almond milk and oat milk, although on the one day I came here the chef was off sick, so I never got to try them.

### ร้านอาหารเจ บุรีรัมย์หลังตลาดเทศบาล

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/qnnmXG8XL4XDRWk47'>ร้านอาหารเจ บุรีรัมย์หลังตลาดเทศบาล</ExternalLink> as this restaurant is named on Google Maps, translates to 'Vegetarian restaurant Buriram behind the municipal market', which is quite a useful way of putting it. It's behind the "midnight market" (which opens at 4pm and closes at 9pm) and is the best option for vegan food in Buriram.

It's your typical point-and-hope เจ ('jay') buffet, but I always thought the quality here was decent, if a little more expensive than equivalent restaurants in other parts of Isaan. This will probably be where you get most of your nourishment in Buriram

### La Paz

<ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/WKknL9mYqY4x4B5b8'>La Paz</ExternalLink> is the easiest restaurant for getting vegan food in Buriram. It a sort-of coffee shop type place, but they have a big food menu, including one vegan page, which contains five items. Each one has a picture and is translated to English, which it's why I say it's the easiest.

If you don't know how to speak Thai (or are just too hungover like I was), then point at the picture and make caveman noises and your point will get across. The portions aren't huge, so I'd suggest getting a couple of items when you come here. The cheapest vegan item is 69 baht, with the most expensive costing 119 baht.

There's plenty of comfortable and the shop is air conditioned, which is always nice.

TODO: Add photos

### The Salad Lab

The last place I'm going to recommend, is a place called <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/pLSjxFLYbmtC6pNq8'>The Salad Lab</ExternalLink>. It's a little shop that only has three tables and is across the street from a large school (so beware of coming here as the kids are getting let out), but it's your typical salad bar.

You take a bowl (small is 89 baht, large is 129 baht), fill it up with as much salad as you can cram in there, and that's about it. The cost includes two proteins, but none of these are vegan so I instead made sure to put plenty of kidney beans and jobs tears in my bowl (they were the only proteiny things available in the salad bar).

It wasn't a very exciting meal, but hey, it got a large quantity and variety of veg into me that day, so it was welcome all the same.

<AccommodationTable details={snowHouseBurriamDetails} />

I have very mixed feelings about Snow House. Some things about it I loved, and some I just didn't.

I had a great start here, because despite arriving here just after 10:30am, they let me check-in right away, despite check-in time not being until 2pm. That's always very welcome, and I found the staff to be very friendly and personable.

But then once I got up to the room, a couple of things instantly annoyed me. The first was that there were cigarette butts on both the floor of the balcony, and in the sink on the balcony. These weren't hard to spot, and as they got ignored by the housekeepers who came into my room everyday of my stay after that, I can assume they just don't get paid to clean the balcony or something, because it was disgusting on there. Just ignore the fact that there's a balcony in this room, because it's just dirty.

The other thing that the cleaners did that annoyed me, was there was no bag in the bin. That's never good for me because I drink so much tea and eat so much fruit, the remnants of which always end up in the bin, that I'm just going to make a mess of the bin if there isn't a bag in there.

I never like to complain, especially if my complaint could get someone else into trouble, as it could the housekeepers if they aren't cleaning the room properly. And they're paid so little that wouldn't be fair. So instead I went to 7-11 to get a plastic bag that I could then use in the bin. Ok, surely they won't forget to replace it again.

Bzzzt, wrong. The next day they actually did replace the bag with another bin liner, but the day after forgot. Off I went to 7-11. By the end of my stay and was just using this bin without a bag, which made it kind of disgusting. I'm not sure what that game was we were playing. It was a bit weird.

Apart from the balcony, the room was actually pretty nice. Huge, east-facing windows, and being up on the fifth floor (out of seven) I was high enough that I could leave the curtains open while I slept, which I always do anyway, but here I didn't have to worry about people watching me sleep. I woke-up drenched in glorious daylight every day, which I love. The desk being right in front of a window was a boon too.

A downside was that the room was just a little bit too small to be comfortable though. I moved the bed about a foot closer to the window than it was when I checked-in. That gave me a bit more space to exercise (although that extra foot of floor space that was previously covered by the bed was predictably dusty), but it just felt a little bit too small. The room was listed at 22m². I've stayed in 22m² rooms before that didn't feel so cramped, but here it just did. There was also an annoying number of ants in the room. They seemed to be everywhere.

Another downside was that the walls just weren't that soundproof. I had a corner room so was only sharing one wall, but anytime the couple in that room were talking, or watching a movie, or fucking, as they did a lot, I got to listen to it. That was fun.

The Internet was fast enough (25.5mbps download, 26.4mbps upload). It was slightly unstable, but mostly ok.

One thing I absolutely loved about this place though, was that apart from the aggressive soi dogs that lived outside, the location here was perfect. It's a short walk from the university, meaning it's a very student-centric are which is my kind of vibe. 7-11 is nearby (about a three minute walk) as are a couple of fruit vendors that setup every day. In the surrounding streets you've got pretty much everything you need, from coffee shops to launderettes (of which there are multiple), and you're an easy walk from Khlong Lalom, which is a great place for a walk or run (above), and the first two vegan-friendly restaurants I mentioned above are easy to get to too.

It's why I have such mixed feelings about Snow House. I either loved or hated everything here. Loved the location. Loved the friendliness of the staff. Loved how much light gets into the room. Hated that the balcony never got cleaned. Hated how many ants were in the room. Hated I could hear the people next door fucking.

In a city like Buriram there aren't that many options, so you take what you can get. I'd certainly look to see if I could find anywhere better before coming back again, but despite everything I've just said, Snow House might still be the best option.
