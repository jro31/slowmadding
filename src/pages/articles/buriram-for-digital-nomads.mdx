The city of Buriram, capital of the Isaan province of the same name, is located about 120km east of Nakhon Ratchasima. With an urban population about 1/18th the size, my expectations were that it would be less developed and even more local. So it was actually a bit of a shock when I arrived here and found it to be more foreigner-friendly than some of the much bigger cities in Isaan.

I didn't realise it until I arrived, but my hotel was about 150m from the campus of Buriram Rajabhat University. If Wikipedia is to be believed, then Buriram Rajabhat University has around 15,000 students. The population of Buriram is less than 24,000, so this is a very, very student-centric town, which I like. Students are young enough that they haven't become embittered by the world yet, so the vibe here is just really positive. It was the exact opposite of what I was expecting.

## How affordable is Buriram?

Buriram is more expensive than you'd expect. As a small city located between Nakhon Ratchasima and Ubon Ratchathani, you'd expect it to be cheaper than them, but it's not the case, and there's actually a small bump in price compared to everywhere else in Isaan I've been.

For example, in Buriram a one-hour massage will typically cost 300 baht. In the rest of Isaan you'd pay 200-250. A small bottle of San Miguel was 99 baht in my most-visited bar here. I'd expect 75 to 80 baht elsewhere. A meal at a local เจ restaurant here cost around 70 baht. An equivalent meal would be 40 to 50 baht elsewhere in Isaan.

These are all pretty insignificant increases in the grand scheme of things, and paying an extra 50 baht for a massage, or an extra 20 baht for a beer isn't going to make much difference unless you're on an extremely tight budget. But if you are, then there are cheaper places to be.

## Is Buriram safe?

As you'd expect in a small, studenty town in Isaan, crime seems basically non-existent here. The biggest risk I encountered were some rather aggressive soi dogs.

It's something I'm very used to. I walk wherever I go, day or night, no matter where I am in the world, which means I'm very often wandering down side roads and encountering packs of stray dogs. You expect them to be territorial and to bark a bit, but I've never felt as close to actually being bitten as I was walking home here on my first night when I got surrounded by a pack of eight to ten dogs. They were very protective of the road right outside my hotel.

I went out a couple of nights later, and thought it would be wise to take a motorcycle taxi back to my room instead of dealing with them again, but then I drank eight beers and decided fuck it, I'll get in a fight with some dogs. I got myself all hyped-up, and then they weren't there. They were obviously off trying to intimidate people outside another hotel, so perhaps it was just a one-off.

Apart from the dogs, Buriram felt very safe.

## Is it easy to get by with English in Buriram?

Frustratingly so. Part of the motivation for the eleven weeks I spent travelling around Isaan was I wanted to be forced to practice my Thai. Perhaps given the high student population here, most people I encountered spoke pretty decent English. Whether buying a train ticket or going to a restaurant or getting a beer, I would in Thai and many people would reply to me in English. It got very annoying.

## Being sociable in Buriram

You won't find any events for meeting new people in Buriram. Or at least I didn't find any events for meeting new people in Buriram. What you will find is more foriegner-aimed bars than in Korat and Ubon Ratchathani combined.

They each only have one bar, so that's not too hard, but still. Dotted around the city you'll find a small number of bars.

One of the better options is <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/zsbJf9cPY5PLZmLRA'>Bee Stop Bar and Grill</ExternalLink>. I came here on my first night in Buriram and loved it. I came here again a couple of days later and they changed the TV from the football game I had requested and was mid-way through, because someone else had requested a different game. I didn't appreciate that, so left pretty quickly and didn't come back for a third time. Based on my first night here it was a fun bar though. Most of the clientel were older foreign men, but that's to be expected anywhere in Isaan.

I also tried <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fdav9eh1C5yy5ZyY6'>Amsterram</ExternalLink>, which as you can probably tell from the name, is a weed themed bar. They sell weed alongside alcohol. I didn't stay for too long here, I found the vibe a bit off. Weed-themed bars are great if you're high, but otherwise the music's just kind of depressing.
