There's very little English on the ticket, but you can see the departure date (01/02/2024), departure time (10:00), seat number (8A) and price without much trouble. The 09:30 scrawled at the top is because they want you to arrive thirty minutes early. This isn't strictly necessary, although you can start boarding about thirty minutes before departure. There are two daily buses to Pattaya, with the other leaving at 12:30pm.",
