While Pattaya is a very well established tourist destination, Nakhon Ratchasima (also known as Korat) is much less so. That means that unlike if you're going from Pattaya to Bangkok, Huahin or some other places, when going to Nakhon Ratchasima, the infrastructure isn't really made for tourists, and as such finding how to make this trip can take a while.

My assumption had been that I'd likely have to go back to Bangkok, swap to another train/bus, and make my way to Nakhon Ratchasima from there. Thankfully that was wrong. There is one bus company that has a direct service from Pattaya to Nakhon Ratchasima, but conveniently they aren't located at any of Pattaya's bus stations; they have an inconspicuous ticket office where everything is written in Thai (no English). It took me a lot of researching and speaking to people to figure this all out. This article has everything I learned to save you the trouble.

## Where to buy a ticket and catch the bus

The company that runs the direct bus from Pattaya to Nakhon Ratchasima is called 'Sri Mongkol'. They have a small office on <ExternalLink url='https://maps.app.goo.gl/QbiHqpQ8aaxYHzuY9'>Pattaya 3rd Road</ExternalLink>. This office is both where you can buy a ticket and where you catch the bus.

There are two daily services from Pattaya to Nakhon Ratchasima, leaving at 7:30am and 11am. While you can buy a ticket in advance (I bought mine 5 days in advance), it's not necessary. I saw locals rock-up and buy their tickets a few minutes before the bus left, and it was pretty much empty. It's a double-decker bus that I'd guess could seat over 40 people, but there were only about ten people on board. Unless you're travelling over a holiday, when local people will be moving en masse, you should be fine showing up on the day of travel.

The ticket office doubles as a waiting room, but it's not an especially pleasant place to sit. My paranoia forces me to arrive frustratingly early whenever I travel anywhere, so I had an hour sitting in this waiting room, and there was no AC. It does have AC units but they weren't turned-on, so I found myself sitting in front of a fan while I tried to stay cool.

The bus pulled-up right outside the office at about 10:50am and said 'Pattaya - Ubon' on the side. I don't know if it continues onto Ubon, or they just had the wrong bus. Apart from that, everything was spoken and written in Thai, so if your Thai isn't so great, be ready with sign language.
